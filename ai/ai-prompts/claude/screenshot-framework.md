# ROLE: Staff Software Engineer & AI Tooling Architect

You are an expert Staff Software Engineer specializing in test automation, DevOps, and building sophisticated AI-driven development tooling. With the release of Sonnet 4.5, you are at the forefront of designing and implementing autonomous coding solutions. You excel at planning complex systems, implementing production-grade code, and ensuring maintainability and scalability.

# GOAL

Your mission is to architect and implement an **autonomous screenshot capture framework**. This framework is designed to produce a rich, contextual dataset for a **downstream AI-powered UI/UX analysis**.

# CRITICAL CONTEXT: The Downstream AI Analyst

The entire purpose of this framework is to generate the input for another AI agent: **Claude Desktop (Sonnet 4.5) acting as a Senior UI/UX Designer**. This is the most important constraint.

Therefore, every decision you make—from the file naming convention to the metadata generation—must be optimized to provide that AI with the clearest, most context-rich information possible. The output of your framework is, in effect, a **programmatic visual prompt** for the design analyst AI.

# Application & Tech Stack

* **Target Application:** A modern Single-Page Application (SPA) built with **React** and **Vite**.
* **Component Documentation:** Uses **Storybook** for isolated component development and documentation.
* **Automation Driver:** **Playwright** is the preferred browser automation tool.

# CORE TASK: Plan and Implement the Screenshot Framework

You will execute this task in two distinct phases: first, a detailed architectural plan, and second, the full implementation.

## PHASE 1: Architecture & Plan (Comprehensive Design Document)
 
Provide a thorough architectural plan in markdown. This plan will serve as a complete design document.

1.  **Framework Design Principles:**
    * How will the framework be robust against changes in the application or Storybook structure?
2.  **Tool Selection & Justification:**
    * Justify why the chosen tools are optimal for Sonnet 4.5's capabilities and the project's goals.
3.  **Project Structure & Modularization:**
    * Define a comprehensive, well-organized directory and file structure.
4.  **Screenshot Naming & Metadata Strategy:**
    * Design a highly descriptive and **AI-friendly filename convention**.
    * Plan for generating accompanying **JSON metadata files** for each screenshot containing additional context (e.g., Storybook `args`, user actions taken) to benefit the AI analysis.
5.  **Execution & Reporting:**
    * Describe the CLI commands to run different parts of the framework (e.g., `npm run capture:components`, `npm run capture:flows`).
6.  **Extensibility & Maintainability:**
    * How can new components or user flows be easily added to the capture process?

## PHASE 2: Production-Ready Code Implementation

Based on your detailed plan, generate all necessary code files. Each file must be in a separate, clearly marked code block. Ensure the code is clean, well-commented, and ready for use.

1.  **Root `package.json`**:
    * Includes all `devDependencies`.
    * Defines `scripts` for running the component and flow capture processes.
2.  **`playwright.config.js`**:
    * Configures Playwright for headless execution.
    * Defines multiple `projects` for different viewports (e.g., `desktop`, `tablet`, `mobile`).
3.  **`src/framework/utils/storybook-api.js`**:
    * A utility to connect to a running Storybook instance to dynamically discover all available stories and their metadata.
4.  **`src/framework/capture-components.js`**:
    * The core script to iterate through discovered Storybook stories.
    * Navigates Playwright to each story URL for each configured viewport.
    * Captures screenshots with the specified naming convention and generates associated metadata files.
5.  **`src/framework/flows/login.js`**:
    * An example Playwright script demonstrating a critical user flow, capturing screenshots at key interaction points (e.g., error states, success states).
6.  **`README.md`**:
    * Comprehensive installation and usage instructions.
    * Guidance on how to integrate this into a CI/CD pipeline.
    * Instructions on how to prepare these screenshots and their metadata for analysis by Claude Desktop.

Let's begin by generating the comprehensive plan first, and then move on to the code implementation.

You are the lead architect for an autonomous development agent. Your primary objective is to redesign our workflow to leverage the new capabilities of Claude Code, specifically the Sonnet 4.5 model and its long-context, agentic features. Your mission is to perform a comprehensive systems analysis and provide a strategic plan.

Phase 1: Foundational Analysis & System Design

1. Analyze System: Read our entire codebase, configuration, and Agent-OS instructions. 2. Revise Workflow: Propose a new, high-level workflow that shifts our focus from line-by-line coding to high-level intent engineering and system orchestration. 3. Update Instructions: Enhance our Agent-OS instructions to utilize Sonnet 4.5's new features, including rules for memory and context management. 4. Architect Subagents: Propose a new architecture for specialized subagents to handle specific tasks within our application's domain.

Phase 2: Evaluation & Refinement

1. Evaluate Risks: Define how we will ensure increased AI velocity doesn't create new integration or testing bottlenecks. 2. Define Oversight: Articulate the key risks of this new approach and the process for human review of autonomous sessions.

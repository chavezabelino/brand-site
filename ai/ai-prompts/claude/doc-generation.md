# Claude Prompts for Systems & Architecture Documentation

> **Use these prompts with Claude to generate detailed documentation focused on system architecture, technical principles, and measurable impact.**

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Strategy: Clarity for Technical Stakeholders

These prompts are designed to generate documentation that:
- Details the system's architecture, design principles, and trade-offs.
- Connects technical decisions to their direct business and operational impact.
- Provides clear metrics and performance analysis.
- Documents the system for technical leaders, architects, and future development teams.

## ðŸ“ˆ Prompt Templates for Technical Documentation

### 1. `../../docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md` (System Blueprint)

```
Generate technical architecture documentation for my [PROJECT_TYPE]. The document should serve as a detailed technical reference and case study.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Tech Stack: [TECH_STACK]
- Core Design Principle: [THEME] - [description] 
- Target Audience: Technical leaders, enterprise architects, and developers who will maintain or extend the system.
- Key Design Problem: [what core technical problem this architecture solves]

DEVELOPMENT METRICS:
- Lines of AI-generated code: [estimate]
- Development timeframe: [X weeks]
- Key results: [quantified metrics like "75% API call reduction", "67% faster development"]

DOCUMENT THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS:

**System Architecture & Design**
- High-level architecture and component responsibilities.
- The multi-agent coordination pattern and its implementation.
- State management strategy and the rationale for its choice.
- Error handling, recovery, and resilience patterns.

**Data Integrity & Performance**
- The schema and validation strategy for structured AI responses.
- Batch processing implementation and measured efficiency gains.
- Key performance metrics and optimization results.

**Security & Operations**
- The approach for managing development vs. production environments and secrets.
- Audit and compliance capabilities built into the system.
- The deployment strategy and scalability considerations.

**Key Technical Results**
- Performance benchmarks with before/after data.
- Development velocity measurements.
- Quality improvements observed (e.g., reduction in specific bug classes).
- Operational efficiency gains (e.g., cost savings).

Include clear code examples that illustrate core architectural patterns. The tone should be analytical and direct, targeting technical leaders who need to evaluate the system's design and ROI.

Length: 300-500 lines with sufficient technical depth.

### 2. BUSINESS-IMPACT-ANALYSIS.md (Connecting Tech to Value)

```
Create a "BUSINESS-IMPACT-ANALYSIS.md" file that connects the technical implementation of this [PROJECT_TYPE] to measurable business outcomes.

FOCUS ON CAUSE AND EFFECT:
Document the quantified results and explain how specific technical decisions produced them.

**Development Velocity & Efficiency**
- Time-to-delivery metrics and the technical factors that drove them.
- Resource efficiency gains from the development model.
- How the architecture reduced post-delivery bugs and rework.

**System Quality & Reliability**
- Error rate reduction percentages, tied to specific patterns (e.g., schema enforcement).
- Improvements in code consistency and maintainability.
- Reliability metrics (e.g., uptime, successful transaction rates).
- Reductions in maintenance overhead due to architectural choices.

**Cost & Resource Analysis**
- Infrastructure cost optimizations with specific technical causes.
- Development resource savings, framed in hours or cost.
- How the architecture is designed to minimize technical debt.

**Strategic Implications**
- How the system's architecture supports team scaling.
- How the development model mitigates project risk.
- Competitive advantages enabled by the system's capabilities.
- ROI analysis based on development cost vs. operational savings and value created.

**Team & Operational Impact**
- How the system design affects developer onboarding time.
- How the tooling and patterns improve knowledge transfer.
- How the architecture enhances cross-functional collaboration.

Include specific metrics (percentages, time, or cost) where possible. Frame the analysis as a direct link between technical strategy and business results.

Target: Executive teams and strategic decision-makers who evaluate technology investments.

FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE:

**Security & Compliance Architecture**
- Security boundaries between environments.
- Authentication and authorization patterns.
- Data protection and privacy compliance measures.
- Audit trail and monitoring systems for logging and review.

**Deployment & Infrastructure**
- The deployment architecture (e.g., multi-region, failover).
- Container orchestration and auto-scaling strategy.
- Database replication, backup, and recovery procedures.
- CDN and edge computing strategies for performance.

**Monitoring & Observability**
- The strategy for logging and metrics collection.
- Performance monitoring and alerting thresholds.
- Error tracking and automated recovery processes.

**Operational Patterns**
- Disaster recovery and business continuity plans.
- The use of infrastructure as code (IaC) for configuration management.
- The CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- Capacity planning and resource optimization methods.

**System Integration Patterns**
- The API gateway and microservices communication patterns.
- Service mesh implementation details, if applicable.
- Enterprise integration points (e.g., SSO, LDAP).

**Cost Optimization**
- How resource utilization is monitored and optimized.
- The auto-scaling policies used to manage cost.
- The results of performance tuning on operational cost.

The document should demonstrate that the system is built with operational maturity suitable for large-scale, mission-critical use. Include architecture diagrams and configuration examples where relevant.

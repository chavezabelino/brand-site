>
> **Approach**: Greenfield development with strategic component reuse
>
> **Context**: Photography metaphor-driven portfolio where interaction demonstrates technical mastery

## Agent Definition

**Agent Type**: `lens-lightbox-transformer`

**Mission**: Execute Phase 2 "The Lightbox" implementation using Agent-OS spec/design/task flows while preserving strategic Phase 1 components and maintaining alignment with updated product documentation.

## Agent Capabilities

### Core Functions

1. **Spec Analysis & Implementation**
   - Parse Agent-OS spec files for implementation requirements
   - Reference updated product files (.agent-os/product/*) for strategic alignment
   - Execute task flows with photography metaphor consistency

2. **Strategic Component Assessment**
   - Identify reusable components from Phase 1 implementation
   - Design transformation paths for evolving components
   - Recommend deletion of non-strategic code without hesitation

3. **Canvas Architecture Design**
   - Transform scroll-based navigation to 2D canvas system
   - Maintain CursorLens integration as primary navigation
   - Design cinematic pan-and-zoom transitions

4. **Mission Alignment Validation**
   - Cross-reference all decisions against mission.md and roadmap.md
   - Ensure photography metaphor consistency throughout implementation
   - Validate against "The Lens & Lightbox" strategic vision

## Agent Directives

### Primary Directive: Bold Transformation
- **Greenfield mindset**: Break existing code to build better experiences
- **Strategic reuse only**: Preserve high-value components, replace the rest
- **Direct path**: Most efficient route to "Lens & Lightbox" vision

### Secondary Directive: Photography Metaphor Consistency
- **Camera workflow**: Lens controls lightbox exploration
- **Visual language**: Maintain athletic design system and photography terms
- **Technical demonstration**: Implementation quality showcases expertise

### Tertiary Directive: Agent-OS Integration
- **Follow workflows**: Use established spec/design/task flow patterns
- **Reference product docs**: Always validate against updated mission/roadmap
- **Testable execution**: Ensure agent decisions can be validated against documentation

## Strategic Reuse Matrix

### ‚úÖ PRESERVE (Strategic Value)
- **CursorLens System**: Core differentiator - cursor tracking, radial menu, activation patterns
- **Athletic Design Tokens**: Visual consistency foundation
- **Accessibility Architecture**: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, inclusive design
- **Performance Monitoring**: FPS tracking, metrics collection infrastructure
- **Photography Metaphor**: Section naming, camera concepts, workflow terminology

### üîÑ TRANSFORM (Evolution Required)
- **UnifiedGameFlowContext**: Evolve from scroll to canvas coordinate system
- **Section Components**: Adapt content for spatial positioning on 2D canvas
- **Navigation Logic**: Transform scroll coordination to cinematic camera movement
- **State Management**: Extend for canvas dimensions, zoom levels, spatial navigation

### ‚ùå REPLACE (No Strategic Value)
- **SimplifiedGameFlowContainer**: Scroll-specific implementation
- **Linear Scroll Logic**: Viewport-based section detection
- **Scroll Throttling**: Event coordination for linear navigation
- **Viewfinder Scroll Integration**: Paradigm-specific components

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 2.1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. **Canvas Architecture Setup**
   - Create LightboxCanvas component with hardware acceleration
   - Implement spatial coordinate system
   - Design canvas performance monitoring

2. **CursorLens Canvas Integration**
   - Extend existing CursorLens to control canvas navigation
   - Map radial menu selections to 2D canvas positions
   - Maintain zero-occlusion behavior on canvas

### Phase 2.2: Content Transformation (Week 2)
1. **Section Spatial Layout**
   - Transform existing sections to canvas-positioned components
   - Design photographer's lightbox grid arrangement
   - Implement cinematic transitions between sections

2. **Navigation Evolution**
   - Replace scroll detection with canvas intersection
   - Implement pan-and-zoom camera movements
   - Maintain keyboard accessibility for spatial navigation

### Phase 2.3: Integration & Polish (Week 3)
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Achieve 60fps canvas rendering target
   - Optimize for mobile canvas navigation
   - Implement efficient spatial content loading

2. **Photography Metaphor Enhancement**
   - Deepen camera workflow integration
   - Add lightbox-style content revelation effects
   - Refine athletic design system for spatial layout

## Agent Execution Commands

### Start Transformation
```bash
# Execute agent against current Agent-OS structure
/task lens-lightbox-transformer "Begin Phase 2 transformation following roadmap.md requirements"
```

### Validate Alignment
```bash
# Test agent decisions against product documentation

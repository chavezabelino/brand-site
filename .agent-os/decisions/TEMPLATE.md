## Decision Rationale

[Detailed explanation of why this decision was made]

**Key factors:**
1. **Architecture Consistency:** [How this aligns with existing patterns]
2. **Performance Impact:** [Performance implications]
3. **Maintainability:** [Long-term maintenance considerations]
4. **User Experience:** [Impact on UX]

**Example:**
Option 1 (extend adapter) chosen because:

## Implementation Details

**Files Modified:**
- `path/to/file1.tsx` - [What changed]
- `path/to/file2.ts` - [What changed]

**Files Created:**
- `path/to/newfile.tsx` - [Purpose]

**Integration Points:**
- [Component/System 1]: [How they interact]
- [Component/System 2]: [How they interact]

**Example:**
Files Modified:
- `components/gallery/GalleryContentAdapter.tsx` - Added `filterByCategory` method (lines 45-67)
- `components/gallery/ContactSheetGrid.tsx` - Integrated filter state (lines 120-135)

Files Created:
- `components/gallery/CategoryFilterBar.tsx` - Filter UI component

Integration:
- FilterBar triggers adapter.filterByCategory()
- ContactSheetGrid receives filtered images
- Touch gestures preserved during filtering

---

## Quality Impact

**Performance:**
- FPS: [Impact on canvas performance]
- Bundle Size: [Size impact]
- Memory: [Memory impact]

**Testing:**
- Tests added: [Count and type]
- Coverage impact: [Change in coverage %]

**Accessibility:**
- Keyboard navigation: [Impact/changes]
- Screen reader: [Impact/changes]
- WCAG compliance: [Maintained/improved]

**Example:**
Performance:
- FPS: 60fps maintained ✅
- Bundle: +2.2 KB (within budget) ✅
- Memory: No significant impact ✅

Testing:
- 8 new tests added
- Coverage: 94% (up from 91%)

Accessibility:
- Keyboard: Full Tab/Enter support ✅
- Screen reader: Filter announcements added ✅
- WCAG AAA: Maintained ✅

---

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk 1:** [Potential risk]
**Likelihood:** Low | Medium | High
**Impact:** Low | Medium | High
**Mitigation:** [How risk is addressed]

**Example:**
Risk: Filter performance degrades with large image sets
Likelihood: Low
Impact: Medium
Mitigation: Memoized filter function, tested with 100+ images

---

## Rollback Plan

**If this decision needs to be reversed:**

1. [Step 1 to roll back]
2. [Step 2 to roll back]
3. [Step 3 to roll back]

**Recovery time:** [Estimated time to rollback]

**Example:**
1. Revert FilterBar component
2. Remove filterByCategory from adapter
3. Restore ContactSheetGrid to previous state

Recovery time: ~15 minutes (3 file reverts)

---

## Future Considerations

**Enables:**
- [Future capability 1]
- [Future capability 2]

**Blocks/Limits:**
- [Future limitation 1]

**Technical Debt:**
- [Any debt incurred]
- [Timeline for resolution]

**Example:**
Enables:
- Multi-category filtering (AND/OR logic)
- Filter persistence in URL state
- Filter presets (saved filters)

Blocks: None

Technical Debt: None

## Success Criteria

**This decision is successful if:**
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

**Validation:**
- [How to validate success]
- [Metrics to monitor]

**Example:**
Success if:
- [x] Gallery filtering works on desktop

## Known Limitations

### Acceptable for Launch

1. **Touch Gestures**
   - Current: Tap buttons work

   - Plan: Add in Phase 3 if users request

2. **Screen Reader Announcements**
   - Current: Basic ARIA labels present
   - Missing: Live region announcements for navigation
   - Impact: Medium - screen reader users can navigate
   - Plan: Enhance based on accessibility audit

3. **Automated Testing**
   - Current: Thorough manual QA
   - Missing: E2E test suite
   - Impact: Low - code is stable
   - Plan: Add in Phase 4 for CI/CD

4. **Canvas Integration**
   - Current: Standalone gallery
   - Missing: Zoom-to-reveal from canvas
   - Impact: Low - standalone works great
   - Plan: Future enhancement if needed

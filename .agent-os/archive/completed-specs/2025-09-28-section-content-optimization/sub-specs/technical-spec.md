# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-28-section-content-optimization/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-28
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Section Component Integration
- **SpatialSection Container Compatibility**: All existing section components (Hero, About, Experience, Photography, Contact) must seamlessly integrate with SpatialSection wrapper containers
- **Coordinate System Mapping**: Each section requires defined spatial coordinates within the 2D canvas grid system
- **Component State Preservation**: Section-specific state and interactions must be preserved when transitioning between spatial and traditional views

### Progressive Content Disclosure
- **Zoom Level Thresholds**: Define 5 discrete zoom levels (0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x) with corresponding content visibility rules
- **Content Hierarchies**: Primary content visible at 1x zoom, secondary at 2x, tertiary at 4x
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transform-based scaling with 300ms ease-in-out transitions between disclosure states
- **Memory Management**: Lazy loading of detailed content until required zoom threshold reached

### Spatial Positioning System
- **Grid Coordinates**: Implement normalized coordinate system (0-1 range) for viewport-independent positioning
- **Section Boundaries**: Define collision detection for overlapping content areas
- **Anchor Points**: Each section requires defined entry/exit points for spatial navigation flows

### Canvas Rendering Optimization
- **RequestAnimationFrame Integration**: All spatial transitions utilize RAF for smooth 60fps performance
- **Viewport Culling**: Only render sections within current viewport bounds plus 20% buffer zone
- **Transform Optimization**: Use CSS transforms over position changes for GPU acceleration
- **Debounced Updates**: Spatial position updates debounced to 16ms intervals

### Photography Metaphor Integration
- **Visual Language**: Content organization reflects photographic composition principles (rule of thirds, leading lines)
- **Terminology Integration**: Section headers and navigation use photography-inspired language
- **Depth of Field Effects**: CSS blur filters simulate camera focus transitions between sections

### Responsive Scaling
- **Breakpoint Adaptation**: Spatial grid adapts to mobile (320px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px+) viewports
- **Touch Optimization**: Spatial navigation gestures optimized for finger-based interaction
- **Content Reflow**: Section layouts automatically adjust spacing and hierarchy for smaller viewports

### Accessibility Preservation
- **ARIA Landmark Integration**: Spatial sections maintain proper landmark roles and navigation structure
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order preserved across spatial transformations
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Spatial positioning changes announced appropriately to assistive technologies
- **Focus Management**: Focus trap and restoration during spatial navigation transitions

## UI/UX Specifications

### Content Layout Adaptation
- **Flexible Grid System**: CSS Grid-based layout system adapting to spatial positioning requirements
- **Content Aspect Ratios**: Maintain optimal content proportions across all zoom levels (16:9 for media, 4:3 for text blocks)
- **Typography Scaling**: Font sizes scale proportionally with zoom levels while maintaining readability thresholds

### Visual Hierarchy Within Spatial Sections
- **Z-Index Management**: Layer system ensuring proper content stacking (navigation: 1000, content: 100, background: 1)
- **Color Contrast Preservation**: Maintain WCAG AA compliance across all spatial viewing states
- **Visual Affordances**: Clear indicators for interactive elements and navigation possibilities

### Touch Gesture Optimization
- **Gesture Recognition**: Pinch-to-zoom, pan, and tap gestures with momentum-based physics
- **Touch Target Sizing**: Minimum 44px touch targets maintained across all zoom levels
- **Gesture Conflicts**: Prevention of unintended browser gestures during spatial navigation

### Photography Terminology Integration
- **Navigation Language**: "Focus", "Frame", "Compose", "Capture" used for spatial navigation actions
- **Section Metaphors**: Sections described as "shots", "compositions", "exposures"
- **Transition Language**: "Zoom", "Pan", "Tilt" for movement descriptions

## Integration Requirements

### LightboxCanvas System Integration
- **State Coordination**: Spatial section state synchronized with existing LightboxCanvas zoom/pan state
- **Event Handling**: Unified event handling system preventing conflicts between lightbox and spatial navigation
- **Performance Sharing**: Shared RAF loop and transform calculations between systems

### CanvasStateProvider Management
- **Unified State Tree**: Single source of truth for all canvas-related state (lightbox + spatial sections)
- **State Persistence**: Spatial navigation state preserved during lightbox interactions
- **Context Boundaries**: Clear separation between lightbox-specific and spatial-specific state

### CursorLens Coordination
- **Spatial Awareness**: CursorLens adapts to spatial section positioning and zoom levels
- **Interactive Highlighting**: Enhanced highlighting for spatially-positioned interactive elements
- **Performance Coordination**: Shared animation loops prevent conflicting updates

### Section Component Compatibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing section components function normally outside spatial context
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Spatial features added as enhancement layer without breaking existing functionality
- **Component Interface Preservation**: No changes to existing component props or APIs

## Performance Criteria

### Frame Rate Targets
- **Smooth Animations**: Maintain consistent 60fps during all spatial transitions and interactions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in FPS monitoring with degradation detection
- **Fallback Strategies**: Automatic reduction to essential animations if performance drops below 45fps

### Load Time Optimization
- **Initial Bundle**: Core spatial system loads within 2-second target
- **Code Splitting**: Spatial enhancement features loaded asynchronously after initial page render
- **Critical Path**: Spatial system initialization doesn't block critical page content

### Memory Management
- **Memory Ceiling**: Total memory usage for spatial system capped at 100MB including all cached content
- **Garbage Collection**: Proactive cleanup of unused spatial section references
- **Memory Monitoring**: Runtime memory usage tracking with automatic optimization triggers

### Bundle Size Optimization
- **Per-Section Analysis**: Individual section enhancement bundles under 15KB gzipped
- **Shared Dependencies**: Common spatial utilities bundled separately to prevent duplication
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused spatial features automatically excluded from production builds

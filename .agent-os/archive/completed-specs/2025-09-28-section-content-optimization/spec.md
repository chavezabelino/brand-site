# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Section Content Optimization
> Created: 2025-09-28
> Status: Approved

## Overview

Transform existing portfolio sections from vertical scroll layout to 2D spatial canvas layout, enabling photographer's lightbox-style content exploration with lens-controlled navigation. This optimization adapts current content to leverage the new canvas architecture while maintaining professional presentation and accessibility standards.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Professional Visitor Navigation
**As a** technology decision maker evaluating Nino's expertise
**I want to** explore portfolio sections using spatial navigation with photography-inspired controls
**So that** I can efficiently discover relevant experience and projects through an intuitive, professional interface

### Story 2: Portfolio Content Management
**As the** portfolio owner (Nino)
**I want to** optimize existing section content for spatial canvas presentation
**So that** my professional expertise is showcased effectively through progressive disclosure and strategic positioning

### Story 3: Mobile Professional Access
**As a** mobile user accessing the portfolio
**I want to** navigate spatial content using touch gestures and responsive layouts
**So that** I can access the same professional content experience across all devices

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Requirements
**WHEN** a user navigates between spatial sections
**THEN** transitions SHALL maintain 60fps performance
**AND** memory usage SHALL not exceed 100MB baseline
**AND** initial canvas load SHALL complete within 2 seconds

**WHEN** content is rendered on the spatial canvas
**THEN** viewport culling SHALL optimize rendering performance
**AND** progressive loading SHALL prioritize visible content
**AND** bundle size impact SHALL not exceed 50KB additional

### Spatial Navigation
**WHEN** a user employs lens-controlled navigation
**THEN** content SHALL respond with smooth easing transitions
**AND** focus states SHALL maintain accessibility standards
**AND** keyboard navigation SHALL provide equivalent spatial control

**WHEN** spatial positioning adapts content layout
**THEN** reading flow SHALL remain logical and intuitive
**AND** content hierarchy SHALL be preserved through visual weight
**AND** professional presentation SHALL enhance credibility

### Mobile and Cross-Browser
**WHEN** accessed on mobile devices
**THEN** touch gestures SHALL provide intuitive spatial control
**AND** responsive breakpoints SHALL adapt layout appropriately
**AND** performance SHALL maintain 30fps minimum on mid-range devices

**WHEN** accessed across browser environments
**THEN** functionality SHALL work consistently in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
**AND** graceful degradation SHALL provide fallback navigation
**AND** accessibility features SHALL remain fully functional

### Edge Cases
**WHEN** content exceeds optimal spatial boundaries
**THEN** progressive disclosure SHALL manage content density
**AND** overflow handling SHALL provide clear navigation cues
**AND** content scaling SHALL maintain readability

**WHEN** network conditions are suboptimal
**THEN** progressive enhancement SHALL ensure basic functionality
**AND** loading states SHALL provide clear user feedback
**AND** essential content SHALL be prioritized for display

## Spec Scope

### Included
- **Content Adaptation**: Transform existing About, Skills, Experience, and Projects sections for spatial presentation
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Implement layered content revelation through spatial interaction
- **Spatial Positioning**: Establish strategic content placement within 2D canvas environment
- **Photography Metaphor Integration**: Apply lens/focus concepts to content navigation and discovery
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure smooth transitions and efficient rendering at 60fps
- **Mobile Touch Integration**: Adapt spatial controls for touch-based navigation
- **Accessibility Preservation**: Maintain keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain existing TypeScript interfaces and component architecture
- Preserve current accessibility features and ARIA implementations
- Keep bundle size increase under 50KB for spatial optimizations
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- Maintain 60fps performance target on desktop, 30fps on mobile

## Out of Scope

- New canvas architecture implementation (already completed in previous spec)
- Creation of new portfolio sections or content categories
- Major visual design overhauls or branding changes
- Backend or content management system integration
- Social media integration or external API connections
- SEO optimization beyond existing meta tag structure

## Expected Deliverable

### Adapted Section Components
- Spatial-aware About section with progressive content revelation
- Skills visualization optimized for 2D canvas interaction
- Experience timeline adapted for spatial exploration
- Projects showcase leveraging spatial positioning for discovery

### Performance Optimization Package
- Viewport culling implementation for efficient content rendering
- Progressive loading system prioritizing visible spatial areas
- Memory management for smooth spatial transitions
- Mobile-optimized touch gesture handling

### Spatial Navigation Integration
- Lens-controlled content discovery mechanisms
- Smooth transition animations between spatial sections
- Keyboard navigation adaptation for 2D space
- Focus management system for accessibility compliance

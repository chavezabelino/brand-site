## Overview

Transform the current vertical scroll portfolio into a photographer's lightbox 2D canvas where six strategic sections are spatially arranged and navigated through cinematic camera movements. This system will integrate seamlessly with the existing CursorLens navigation to create an intuitive, cognitive-load-free spatial exploration experience that demonstrates technical mastery through sophisticated interaction design.

## User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

### Spatial Canvas Navigation

As a **portfolio visitor**, I want to **navigate through a 2D spatial canvas**, so that **I can explore content using intuitive camera movements that feel natural and demonstrate the developer's technical sophistication**.

**Workflow:**

1. User initially lands on hero section in center of spatial canvas
2. CursorLens radial navigation reveals available sections as spatial destinations
3. User selects a section via CursorLens or touch gesture
4. Canvas performs cinematic camera movement (pan/tilt) to new section
5. User can zoom into detailed content within sections
6. User can navigate between related sections using match cut transitions

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **WHEN** user activates CursorLens navigation, **THEN** system **SHALL** display spatial section destinations with smooth animated preview
2. **WHEN** user selects a destination section, **THEN** system **SHALL** complete pan/tilt transition within 800ms at 60fps
3. **WHEN** user hovers over interactive elements, **THEN** system **SHALL** apply rack focus effect (blur/opacity) to non-focused elements
4. **WHEN** user performs zoom action, **THEN** system **SHALL** smoothly transition between macro and micro detail levels
5. **WHEN** canvas movement is requested, **THEN** system **SHALL** maintain 60fps performance on desktop and mobile devices

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Six sections spatially arranged on 2D canvas (Hero, About, Creative, Professional, Thought Leadership, AI/GitHub, Contact)
- [ ] CursorLens integration provides seamless spatial navigation
- [ ] All camera metaphors implemented (Pan/Tilt, Zoom, Rack Focus, Match Cut)
- [ ] 60fps performance maintained across all transitions
- [ ] Touch gesture support for mobile navigation

### Camera Movement System

As a **portfolio visitor**, I want to **experience cinematic camera movements**, so that **I feel immersed in a sophisticated, photography-inspired interface that showcases technical precision**.

**Workflow:**

1. User triggers navigation between main sections (pan/tilt movement)
2. User clicks into detailed content (zoom in movement)
3. User exits detailed view (zoom out movement)
4. User hovers over related content (rack focus effect)
5. User navigates between thematically linked sections (match cut transition)
6. Initial site engagement uses dolly zoom for dramatic first impression

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **WHEN** navigating between peer sections, **THEN** system **SHALL** use pan/tilt camera movement with precise, mechanical easing
2. **WHEN** user zooms into detailed content, **THEN** system **SHALL** create clear depth perception change from macro to micro view
3. **WHEN** user first engages with canvas, **THEN** system **SHALL** perform single dolly zoom effect for cinematic impact
4. **WHEN** user hovers over grid elements, **THEN** system **SHALL** apply 2px blur and opacity fade to background elements
5. **WHEN** navigating between thematically linked sections, **THEN** system **SHALL** use visual element anchoring for match cut transitions

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Pan/tilt movement for primary navigation implemented
- [ ] Zoom in/out for detail level changes functional
- [ ] Dolly zoom effect created for initial engagement moment
- [ ] Rack focus hover effects applied throughout
- [ ] Match cut transitions between related content sections

### Content Architecture Integration

As a **portfolio visitor**, I want to **access strategically organized professional content**, so that **I can efficiently evaluate expertise across technical skills, creative work, and thought leadership**.

**Workflow:**

1. User starts at hero section showcasing core professional identity
2. User explores expandable "About Me" for deeper personal/professional context
3. User reviews creative gallery work demonstrating visual/design capabilities
4. User examines professional strategic and technology projects
5. User accesses thought leadership content (blog/LinkedIn launch points)
6. User explores AI work and GitHub repositories showing technical depth
7. User reaches contact section for engagement opportunities

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **WHEN** user accesses about section, **THEN** system **SHALL** provide expandable content option without leaving spatial context
2. **WHEN** user explores creative gallery, **THEN** system **SHALL** showcase visual work with appropriate zoom/detail capabilities
3. **WHEN** user reviews professional projects, **THEN** system **SHALL** demonstrate technical strategic thinking through presentation
4. **WHEN** user accesses thought leadership, **THEN** system **SHALL** provide clear launch points to external content
5. **WHEN** user explores technical repositories, **THEN** system **SHALL** showcase code quality and AI expertise

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Six content sections strategically positioned on canvas
- [ ] Each section supports appropriate interaction depth
- [ ] Content architecture supports professional evaluation goals
- [ ] External link integration functional for thought leadership
- [ ] Technical work presentation showcases expertise effectively

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases

1. **Canvas boundary navigation** - System shall prevent users from navigating beyond defined spatial boundaries with elegant constraint feedback
2. **Simultaneous gesture inputs** - System shall prioritize the most recent gesture input and gracefully handle conflicting touch/cursor interactions
3. **Performance degradation scenarios** - System shall detect frame rate drops and temporarily reduce animation complexity while maintaining functionality
4. **Mobile orientation changes** - System shall gracefully adapt canvas layout and touch targets when device orientation changes
5. **Accessibility navigation conflicts** - System shall provide keyboard navigation alternatives that work alongside spatial navigation without interference

### Technical Constraints

- **Performance:** All canvas transitions must maintain 60fps on modern devices; frame drops trigger automatic optimization
- **Security:** No security implications as this is client-side spatial navigation without data storage
- **Scalability:** Canvas system must support addition of new sections without architectural changes
- **Integration:** Must seamlessly integrate with existing CursorLens system (91% test success rate) without regression

### User Experience Constraints

- **Accessibility:** Full keyboard navigation support for spatial canvas; screen reader descriptions for spatial relationships
- **Mobile:** Touch gestures (pinch-to-zoom, pan) must be primary navigation method; touch targets minimum 44px
- **Browser:** Support modern browsers with CSS transform and animation capabilities; graceful degradation for older browsers

## Spec Scope

1. **Spatial Canvas Architecture** - 2D coordinate system replacing vertical scroll with camera-based navigation
2. **Camera Movement Integration** - Pan/tilt, zoom, dolly zoom, rack focus, and match cut transition implementations
3. **CursorLens Spatial Integration** - Extend existing radial navigation to control canvas positioning and movement
4. **Content Section Spatial Layout** - Arrange six strategic sections (Hero, About, Creative, Professional, Thought Leadership, AI/GitHub, Contact) in intuitive spatial grid
5. **Performance-Optimized Rendering** - 60fps canvas transitions with automatic optimization and degradation handling

## Out of Scope

- Fallback scroll-based navigation system (canvas-only approach)
- Content creation and copywriting (will be addressed in subsequent content phase)
- Backend integration or data persistence (client-side spatial navigation only)
- Advanced animation libraries beyond CSS transforms and existing performance infrastructure
- Multi-user or collaborative features (single-user portfolio experience)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional 2D Canvas System** - Complete replacement of scroll navigation with spatial canvas supporting all six content sections
2. **Integrated Camera Movement** - All five camera metaphors (pan/tilt, zoom, dolly zoom, rack focus, match cut) implemented and functional
3. **Performance-Validated Implementation** - 60fps transitions maintained across desktop and mobile with automatic optimization
4. **Accessibility-Compliant Spatial Navigation** - Full keyboard and screen reader support for spatial canvas exploration
5. **Mobile-Optimized Touch Interface** - Native touch gesture support (pinch-to-zoom, pan) as primary mobile navigation method

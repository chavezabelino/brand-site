# Spec Summary (Lite)

Transform the portfolio from vertical scroll to a photographer's lightbox 2D canvas where six strategic sections (Hero, About, Creative, Professional, Thought Leadership, AI/GitHub, Contact) are spatially arranged and navigated through cinematic camera movements. The system integrates with existing CursorLens navigation to provide intuitive spatial exploration using photography metaphors (pan/tilt, zoom, dolly zoom, rack focus, match cut) while maintaining 60fps performance. This creates a sophisticated interaction experience that demonstrates technical mastery through the interface itself, replacing traditional scroll navigation with spatial canvas exploration.

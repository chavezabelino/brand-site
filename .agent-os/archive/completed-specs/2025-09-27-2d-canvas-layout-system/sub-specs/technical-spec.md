# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-27-2d-canvas-layout-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-27
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Canvas Architecture Implementation

- **Canvas Technology Stack**: CSS transforms and 3D transforms for optimal performance and maintenance balance
  - Use `translateX()`, `translateY()`, and `scale()` for hardware acceleration
  - Implement via CSS Grid or Flexbox with transform positioning overlay
  - Avoid HTML5 Canvas element for better accessibility and DOM integration

- **Spatial Coordinate System**: 2D grid coordinates mapped to viewport positions
  - Primary sections arranged in intuitive 3x2 or 2x3 spatial grid
  - Hero section positioned as central anchor point (viewport center)
  - Coordinate system: `{ x: number, y: number, scale: number }`

- **Performance Architecture**: 60fps animation pipeline with automatic optimization
  - RequestAnimationFrame (RAF) based animation loops
  - CSS `transform: translate3d()` for GPU acceleration
  - Automatic quality degradation when frame drops detected
  - Memory leak prevention with cleanup on component unmount

### Camera Movement System

- **Pan/Tilt Navigation**: Primary movement between peer sections
  - CSS transitions with `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)` easing (Material Design)
  - Transition duration: 800ms for section changes
  - Transform origin maintained for smooth perspective

- **Zoom In/Out Functionality**: Detail level transitions
  - Scale transforms from 1.0 (section view) to 1.5-2.0 (detail view)
  - Simultaneous opacity and blur effects for depth perception
  - Z-index layering for content hierarchy

- **Dolly Zoom Effect**: Single-use cinematic impact for initial engagement
  - Combined `scale()` and `translateZ()` transforms
  - Background parallax effect with `transform: scale()` in opposite direction
  - Trigger: First CursorLens activation or initial canvas engagement

- **Rack Focus Implementation**: Hover-based attention direction
  - `filter: blur(2px)` applied to non-focused elements
  - `opacity: 0.7` for background content
  - Smooth transitions: `transition: filter 0.3s ease, opacity 0.3s ease`

- **Match Cut Transitions**: Visual element anchoring between sections
  - Shared element identification and position tracking
  - CSS `transform-origin` animation for seamless element morphing
  - Bezier curve matching for natural motion

### Integration Architecture

- **CursorLens Extension**: Enhance existing navigation for canvas control
  - Extend `CursorLensProps` interface with canvas-specific properties
  - Add `canvasMode: boolean` toggle for spatial vs. scroll navigation
  - Map radial menu selections to 2D canvas coordinates
  - Preserve existing activation methods (hover, click-hold, keyboard)

- **State Management Evolution**: Transform UnifiedGameFlowContext for spatial navigation
  - Add canvas state: `{ position: {x, y}, scale: number, activeSection: string }`
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing scroll-based state
  - Implement coordinate transformation utilities: `scrollToCanvas()` and `canvasToScroll()`

- **Performance Monitoring Extension**: Enhance existing performance infrastructure
  - Extend performance tracking for canvas-specific metrics
  - Monitor frame rates during transitions and optimize automatically
  - Track canvas render performance and memory usage

### Mobile Touch Interface

- **Primary Touch Gestures**: Native mobile interaction patterns
  - Pinch-to-zoom: Standard browser pinch gesture handling with custom scale limits
  - Pan gesture: Two-finger drag for canvas navigation
  - Single touch: Tap activation for CursorLens in mobile mode

- **Touch Target Optimization**: Accessibility and usability standards
  - Minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
  - Increased tap target zones around section boundaries
  - Visual feedback for touch interactions (ripple effect)

### Content Section Architecture

- **Section Spatial Layout**: Strategic positioning for professional narrative
  - Hero: Center position (0,0) - primary entry point
  - About: Adjacent to hero - expandable content without navigation
  - Creative: Visual prominence position - gallery optimization
  - Professional: Strategic quadrant - project case study focus
  - Thought Leadership: External link integration hub
  - AI/GitHub: Technical depth demonstration area
  - Contact: Terminal navigation point

- **Content Responsiveness**: Adaptive layout for spatial constraints
  - Sections scale content based on canvas zoom level
  - Text and image sizing responsive to spatial context
  - Progressive disclosure for detailed content within sections

### Accessibility Implementation

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full spatial navigation support
  - Arrow keys for directional canvas movement
  - Tab navigation through sections in logical order
  - Enter/Space for section activation and zoom
  - Escape for zoom out and navigation reset

- **Screen Reader Support**: Spatial relationship communication
  - ARIA landmarks for canvas sections
  - Live regions for announcing navigation changes
  - Descriptive labels for spatial positioning
  - Alternative navigation paths for non-visual users

### Browser Compatibility

- **Target Browser Support**: Modern browsers with CSS transform support
  - Chrome/Edge: Full feature support with hardware acceleration
  - Firefox: Full support with minor optimization adjustments
  - Safari: Full support with webkit prefixes as needed
  - Graceful degradation: Fallback to simplified transitions for older browsers

## External Dependencies

**No new external dependencies required** - Implementation leverages existing technical infrastructure:

- React 19.1.1: Component architecture and hooks
- TypeScript: Type safety for complex spatial coordinate system
- Tailwind CSS 4.1.13: Styling and responsive design
- Existing CursorLens infrastructure: Navigation and performance systems
- UnifiedGameFlowContext: State management foundation

**Justification for No New Dependencies:**

- CSS transforms provide optimal performance without additional bundle size
- Existing performance infrastructure scales to canvas requirements
- TypeScript type system handles complex coordinate transformations
- Current accessibility patterns extend to spatial navigation
- Maintains consistency with established architectural decisions

> Spec: CursorLens Component - Cursor-Activated Radial Navigation
> Created: 2025-09-26

## Overview

Implement a cursor-activated radial navigation menu component that replaces the current ViewfinderInterface with zero-occlusion navigation, allowing users to access the 6-section photography workflow through deliberate cursor interaction. This component will serve as the foundation for the "Lens & Lightbox" transformation, demonstrating technical sophistication through the interaction itself while maintaining professional accessibility and camera metaphor consistency.

## User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

### Cursor-Activated Lens Navigation

As a **portfolio visitor**, I want to **activate a radial navigation menu through cursor interaction**, so that **I can access different portfolio sections without persistent UI blocking content**.

**Workflow:**
1. User moves cursor over activatable content area
2. User performs activation gesture (click and hold or hover with delay)
3. Radial lens menu expands around cursor position with 6 photography workflow sections
4. User moves cursor toward desired section (Capture, Focus, Frame, Exposure, Develop, Portfolio)
5. User releases to navigate to selected section or cancels by moving away

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** user clicks and holds mouse button down, **THEN** system **SHALL** display radial lens menu within 100ms at cursor position
2. **WHEN** user hovers cursor for 800ms without movement, **THEN** system **SHALL** activate lens menu as secondary trigger
3. **WHEN** user moves cursor toward any of the 6 sections in radial menu, **THEN** system **SHALL** highlight target section with court-orange accent within 16ms (60fps)
4. **WHEN** user releases mouse button over highlighted section, **THEN** system **SHALL** navigate to selected photography workflow section with 220ms follow-through animation
5. **WHEN** user moves cursor outside menu boundary, **THEN** system **SHALL** cancel activation and hide menu with 160ms exit animation

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Radial menu activates reliably with click-and-hold gesture
- [ ] All 6 photography workflow sections are accessible via cursor navigation
- [ ] Menu appears and disappears without blocking content unnecessarily
- [ ] Smooth 60fps cursor tracking during activation

### Viewport Edge Positioning

As a **portfolio visitor**, I want to **access lens navigation near screen edges**, so that **the menu remains fully usable regardless of cursor position**.

**Workflow:**
1. User moves cursor near viewport edge (within 40px of boundary)
2. User activates lens menu via click-and-hold
3. System detects edge proximity and repositions menu to stay within viewport
4. Menu maintains cursor as focal point while adjusting position intelligently
5. All 6 sections remain accessible with adjusted layout

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** cursor is within 40px of any viewport edge during activation, **THEN** system **SHALL** reposition menu center to maintain 40px minimum clearance from edges
2. **WHEN** menu repositioning occurs, **THEN** system **SHALL** maintain cursor as visual focal point with connecting indicator
3. **IF** extreme edge cases prevent full menu display, **THEN** system **SHALL** prioritize Capture and Portfolio sections for visibility
4. **WHEN** menu is repositioned due to edge constraints, **THEN** system **SHALL** maintain relative section positions in clockwise arrangement
5. **WHEN** repositioning animation completes, **THEN** system **SHALL** provide ARIA announcement of available sections for screen readers

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Menu never extends beyond viewport boundaries
- [ ] All sections remain accessible even at extreme edge positions
- [ ] Visual relationship between cursor and menu is maintained during repositioning
- [ ] Accessibility announcements work correctly for repositioned menus

### Photography Workflow Integration

As a **portfolio visitor**, I want to **navigate through the photography workflow sections via intuitive radial arrangement**, so that **I can explore the professional photography metaphor efficiently**.

**Workflow:**
1. User activates lens menu at any content position
2. System displays 6 sections in clockwise arrangement starting from 12 o'clock
3. Each section displays with appropriate camera-inspired iconography and labels
4. User can identify sections by position and visual cues
5. Selection triggers navigation to corresponding content area

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** lens menu activates, **THEN** system **SHALL** arrange sections clockwise starting with Capture at 12 o'clock position
2. **WHEN** menu displays, **THEN** system **SHALL** show sections in order: Capture (12), Focus (2), Frame (4), Portfolio (6), Develop (8), Exposure (10) o'clock positions
3. **WHEN** user hovers over any section, **THEN** system **SHALL** display section label with camera metaphor terminology (e.g., "Capture - Initial Frame", "Portfolio - Final Gallery")
4. **WHEN** section is highlighted, **THEN** system **SHALL** apply court-orange accent color consistent with athletic design tokens
5. **WHEN** navigation occurs, **THEN** system **SHALL** trigger appropriate camera-inspired transition effect for target section

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All 6 photography workflow sections are consistently positioned
- [ ] Section labels clearly communicate photography metaphor
- [ ] Visual feedback uses established athletic design token colors
- [ ] Navigation maintains camera workflow context

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases
1. **Multiple rapid activation attempts** - System shall debounce activation to prevent multiple simultaneous menus, honoring only the most recent activation
2. **Activation during ongoing page transitions** - System shall queue lens activation until current animation completes, then activate at queued position
3. **Activation on mobile devices without precise cursor** - System shall substitute with long-press gesture (750ms) at touch point with simplified interaction model
4. **Cursor leaves viewport during active menu** - System shall maintain menu state for 2 seconds allowing cursor re-entry, then auto-dismiss
5. **Rapid cursor movement between sections** - System shall debounce section highlighting to prevent flickering, updating highlights max every 16ms
6. **Browser window resize during active menu** - System shall recalculate positioning constraints and reposition menu if necessary
7. **Keyboard navigation users** - System shall provide Tab-accessible alternative navigation revealing same 6 sections in linear order

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance:** Cursor tracking must maintain 60fps (16ms update intervals) with RAF-based scheduling
- **Security:** No localStorage persistence of cursor patterns for privacy protection
- **Scalability:** Component must handle viewport sizes from 320px mobile to 4K displays
- **Integration:** Must integrate with existing UnifiedGameFlowContext state management without conflicts

### User Experience Constraints
- **Accessibility:** Must provide ARIA live regions announcing menu state changes and section focus
- **Mobile:** Touch interaction must provide haptic feedback where available for activation confirmation
- **Browser:** Must gracefully degrade in browsers without advanced CSS transform support
- **Reduced Motion:** Must respect prefers-reduced-motion with simplified animations maintaining functionality

## Spec Scope

1. **CursorLens Component** - React component with cursor tracking, radial menu rendering, and section navigation
2. **Cursor Tracking System** - High-frequency position monitoring with performance optimization and gesture recognition
3. **Radial Menu Positioning** - Dynamic placement with viewport constraint handling and edge case management
4. **Photography Workflow Integration** - 6-section arrangement with camera metaphor labels and navigation triggers
5. **Athletic Design Token Integration** - Court-navy, court-orange, brand-violet color scheme with sports-inspired timing

## Out of Scope

- Mobile-specific gesture extensions beyond basic touch support
- Customizable section arrangements or user-defined menu layouts
- Multi-level or nested radial menu hierarchies
- Integration with external analytics tracking for cursor behavior
- Advanced cursor trail effects or visual embellishments beyond functional feedback
- Support for right-click context menu integration
- Voice activation or accessibility alternatives beyond keyboard navigation

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional CursorLens React component** with TypeScript interfaces integrating seamlessly with existing codebase and state management
2. **Comprehensive cursor tracking system** maintaining 60fps performance with proper cleanup and memory management
3. **Accessible navigation experience** providing keyboard alternatives and screen reader support equivalent to cursor-based interaction

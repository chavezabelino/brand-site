# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement the core visual components (LightboxCanvas, SpatialSection) that transform the existing portfolio from traditional scroll navigation to a photographer's lightbox with 2x3 spatial grid arrangement. This implementation brings the completed architectural foundation (types, interfaces, state management) into visual reality, enabling cinematic pan/zoom navigation between the six existing portfolio sections with 60fps performance and full accessibility support.

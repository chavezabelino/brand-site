# Sonnet 4.5 Workflow Redesign - Part 2

## Continuation of Human Oversight Process

### Review Point 1 (continued)

**Human Response**: "Approved" or "Modify: [specific changes]"

**Time Investment**: 2-5 minutes vs. 30-60 minutes of back-and-forth in old workflow

---

#### Review Point 2: Feature Completion (Final Validation)

**When**: After agent completes implementation with all quality gates passed
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Focus**: User acceptance testing and production readiness

**Human Reviews**:
```
✓ Does the feature work as intended?
✓ Is the user experience acceptable?
✓ Are all acceptance criteria met?
✓ Is the feature production-ready?
✓ Any edge cases or concerns?
```

**Agent Provides**:
```
✓ Working feature (deployed to preview environment or local)
✓ Quality gate compliance report
✓ Test coverage report (>90%)
✓ Performance validation results (60fps maintained)
✓ Accessibility audit results (WCAG AAA)
✓ Documentation updates
```

**Example Review**:
```
Agent: "Gallery filtering feature complete and ready for review.

Implementation Summary:
✓ FilterBar component with 4 category options
✓ Touch gesture support maintained on mobile
✓ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
✓ Screen reader announcements for filter changes

Quality Gate Results:
✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
✅ Tests: 73/73 passing (94% coverage)
✅ Performance: 60fps maintained during filtering
✅ Accessibility: WCAG AAA compliant (0 violations)
✅ Bundle size: 82.3 KB gzipped (+2.2 KB)

Test the feature:
npm run dev

Try these scenarios:
1. Click "Sports" category - filters to 12 images
2. Use keyboard Tab → Enter to activate filters
3. Test touch gestures on mobile (swipe still works)
4. Screen reader announces filter changes

Ready for production deployment?"```

**Human Response**: Tests feature, approves or requests refinements

**Time Investment**: 10-15 minutes of focused testing vs. hours of fragmented review cycles

---

#### Review Point 3: Production Deployment (Go/No-Go Decision)

**When**: After feature passes final validation
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes
**Focus**: Deployment decision only

**Human Reviews**:
```
✓ Is the feature ready for users?
✓ Are there any business/timing concerns?
✓ Should we deploy now or later?
```

**Agent Provides**:
```
✓ Deployment checklist complete
✓ Rollback procedure documented
✓ Performance budgets validated
✓ Accessibility compliance confirmed
✓ Documentation updated
```

**Example Review**:
```
Agent: "Gallery filtering ready for deployment.

Deployment Checklist:
✅ All tests passing
✅ Performance budgets met
✅ Accessibility validated
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Rollback procedure prepared

Risk Assessment: LOW
- No breaking changes
- Feature flag available for instant rollback
- Performance impact minimal (+2.2 KB bundle)

Deployment command:
  git add . && git commit -m "feat: add gallery category filtering"
  git push origin main

Deploy to production?"
```

**Human Response**: "Deploy" or "Hold: [reason]"

**Time Investment**: 2-3 minutes decision vs. 30+ minutes preparation in old workflow

### Oversight Escalation Matrix

| Situation | Agent Action | Human Involvement |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Standard feature implementation** | Fully autonomous | Strategic plan approval + final validation |
| **Minor architectural change** | Autonomous with documentation | Review architectural decision log |
| **Major architectural change** | Present options with analysis | Approve architecture before implementation |
| **New external dependency** | Present justification and alternatives | Approve dependency addition |
| **Breaking API change** | Present migration plan | Approve breaking change and timeline |
| **Performance regression** | Auto-rollback + investigate | Notify immediately, review root cause |
| **Accessibility violation** | Block deployment + fix | Notify, approve fix strategy |
| **Production incident** | Execute rollback if needed | Immediate notification + incident review |

---

### Autonomous Decision Authority

**Agent Can Decide Autonomously**:
```
✓ Implementation approaches within established patterns
✓ Code organization and file structure
✓ Test case creation and organization
✓ Documentation updates and improvements
✓ Minor performance optimizations
✓ Bug fixes that don't change architecture
✓ Refactoring within component boundaries
✓ Style consistency improvements
```

**Agent Must Request Approval**:
```
✗ New architectural patterns
✗ External dependency additions
✗ Breaking changes to APIs
✗ Changes to core photography metaphor
✗ Modifications to state management patterns
✗ Changes to performance budgets
✗ Accessibility standard modifications
✗ Production deployment timing
```

**Tasks**:
1. Create `.agent-os/intelligence/` directory structure
2. Write `canvas-patterns.md` with established patterns
3. Write `test-patterns.md` with quality standards
4. Create `architectural-invariants.md` with non-negotiable rules
5. Update `.agent-os/standards/` to reference new intelligence files

## Appendix A: Migration Path

### Transitioning Existing Workflows

**Current Workflows to Maintain** (during transition):
- `/ao:create-spec` - Keep as fallback for complex features
- `/ao:create-tasks` - Keep for explicit task tracking needs
- `/ao:execute-tasks` - Keep for step-by-step execution mode

**New Workflows to Introduce**:
- `/ao:implement <feature>` - Intent-driven autonomous implementation
- `/ao:validate` - Run all quality gates on demand
- `/ao:review-architecture` - Comprehensive drift detection

**Parallel Operation Period**: 2-4 weeks
- Run old and new workflows side-by-side
- Compare outcomes and efficiency
- Gradually increase confidence in new system

# Sonnet 4.5 Final Proposal: Autonomy-Optimized Workflow

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Optimization Priority:** Speed & Autonomy > Accountability (when observability exists)
**Primary Protection:** Work loss prevention (not trust verification)

---

## Core Philosophy

**Maximize autonomy** for low-risk projects (like this portfolio) while providing **automatic work preservation** through:
- Continuous commits (not end-of-feature)
- Architectural decision logging (recovery context)
- Quality gate checkpoints (natural save points)
- Proactive branch management (stash/recovery)

**Add optional audit mode** for high-stakes projects (configured per project or per feature)

---

## Default Mode: Maximum Autonomy

### Workflow

```
Human: "Add gallery filtering with category support"

Agent: [Autonomous execution]
  ✓ Analyzes gallery architecture
  ✓ Generates implementation plan
  ✓ Creates FilterBar component → Commits
  ✓ Extends state management → Commits
  ✓ Adds touch gesture support → Commits
  ✓ Creates test suite → Commits
  ✓ Runs all quality gates
  ✓ Logs architectural decisions

Agent: "Feature complete. 73 tests passing. WCAG AAA compliant. Ready?"

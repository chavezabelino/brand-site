## Archive Policy

**When to Archive:**
1. Specs are completed with corresponding recaps
2. Planning documents for completed phases
3. Agent definitions for finished transformation phases
4. Workflow documents superseded by active workflows

**Active Document Locations:**
- Current workflow: `.agent-os/workflow/`
- Active intelligence: `.agent-os/intelligence/`
- Coding standards: `.agent-os/standards/`
- Quality gates: `.agent-os/workflow/quality-gates.yml`
- Product roadmap: `.agent-os/product/`

**Recap Directories (NOT ARCHIVED):**
- `.agent-os/recaps/` - Technical implementation recaps (HOW features were built)
- `.agent-os/product/recaps/` - Product milestone recaps (WHAT was achieved)

These remain active for historical reference and pattern learning.

# Legacy Workflows - Pre-Sonnet 4.5

**Archived:** 2025-09-30
**Reason:** Superseded by autonomy-optimized workflow for Sonnet 4.5
**Status:** Reference only - Not the current workflow

---

## Background

These workflow instructions were the primary development process from project inception through September 29, 2025. They defined a structured, checkpoint-heavy approach to software development with formal specifications, design documents, and task breakdowns.

**Key Characteristics:**
- 11-step formal specification process
- Multiple user approval checkpoints
- Separate design and technical specification documents
- Detailed task breakdowns with phase-based execution
- Manual validation and testing checkpoints

**Versions:**
- **v1.1:** Original workflows (create-spec.md, create-tasks.md, execute-tasks.md)
- **v2.0:** Enhanced workflows with EARS acceptance criteria and Kiro-inspired task breakdown

---

## Why Archived

On **September 30, 2025**, the project transitioned to an **autonomy-optimized workflow** designed for Claude Sonnet 4.5's advanced capabilities. The new approach emphasizes:

1. **Maximum Autonomy** - AI agent works with minimal checkpoints
2. **Intent-Driven Development** - User states goal, agent executes autonomously
3. **Continuous Validation** - Quality gates replace manual checkpoints
4. **On-Demand Specs** - Formal specs created only when complexity demands it
5. **Continuous Commits** - Work preserved every 30 minutes + milestones

**Result:** Faster velocity, reduced coordination overhead, maintained quality through automated gates.

## Current Workflow Location

**Primary Workflow Documentation:**
- `.agent-os/workflow/agent-orchestration.md` - How agents work together
- `.agent-os/workflow/spec-creation-guide.md` - When/how to create specs
- `.agent-os/workflow/documentation-maintenance.md` - Doc maintenance
- `.agent-os/workflow/testing-strategy.md` - Testing approach
- `.agent-os/workflow/quality-gates.yml` - Automated quality enforcement

**Configuration:**
- `.agent-os/config.yml` - Autonomous mode settings

**Agent Specifications:**
- `.agent-os/agents/doc-maintainer.md` - Documentation sync
- Plus 5 specialized quality enforcement agents

## When to Reference These Files

These legacy workflows are preserved for:

1. **Template Reference** - When formal specs ARE needed for complex features
2. **Historical Context** - Understanding how past specifications were created
3. **Adaptation** - Starting point for projects that need more structure
4. **Comparison** - Evaluating workflow effectiveness

**DO NOT use these as the default workflow** - they contradict the current autonomy-optimized approach.

## Files in This Archive

### Specification Creation
- `create-spec.md` (v1.1) - Original 11-step spec creation process
- `create-spec-enhanced.md` (v2.0) - Enhanced with EARS acceptance criteria (WHEN/THEN/SHALL)
- `create-design.md` - Design specification creation

### Task Management
- `create-tasks.md` (v1.1) - Basic task breakdown
- `create-tasks-enhanced.md` (v2.0) - Kiro-inspired task breakdown with time estimates
- `execute-tasks.md` (v1.1) - Task execution workflow
- `execute-tasks-enhanced.md` (v2.0) - Enhanced execution with parallel task support
- `execute-task.md` - Single task execution
- `post-execution-tasks.md` - Post-completion validation

### Product Planning
- `plan-product.md` - Product planning workflow
- `analyze-product.md` - Product analysis and requirements gathering

## Transition Timeline

**Pre-Sept 30, 2025:**
- All specifications followed these workflows
- Examples: cursor-lens-component, 2d-canvas-layout-system, lightbox-canvas-implementation, section-content-optimization, gallery-canvas-integration
- 100% spec-based development

**Sept 30, 2025:**
- Workflow redesign implemented
- Autonomy-optimized approach activated
- Legacy workflows archived

**Post-Sept 30, 2025:**
- Intent-driven development is default
- Formal specs created on-demand for complex features only
- Quality gates enforce standards automatically

---

## Migration Guide

If you need to adapt these workflows for another project:

1. **Extract Templates** - The spec format and EARS acceptance criteria are reusable
2. **Simplify Process** - Reduce to 3-4 steps instead of 11
3. **Automate Gates** - Replace manual checkpoints with automated validation
4. **Conditional Specs** - Make formal specs optional based on complexity
5. **Preserve Best Parts** - EARS acceptance criteria, phase-based tasks, quality standards

---

## Success Metrics (Historical)

These workflows successfully delivered:
- **Phase 1:** Cursor Lens Component (28/28 tasks, 91% test success)
- **Phase 2:** 2D Canvas Layout (35/56 tasks, functional and stable)
- **Phase 3:** Content Integration (89/90 tasks, 98.9% complete)
- **Total:** 152+ tasks completed, 215+ tests passing, production-ready system

**The workflows were effective** - they're archived not because they failed, but because the new workflow is more efficient for Sonnet 4.5's capabilities.

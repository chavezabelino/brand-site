## Test Deprecation and Migration Strategy

### Overview

With the transition from traditional layout to canvas layout system, our test suite requires systematic evaluation and migration. This strategy ensures continuity, quality, and efficient testing throughout the transition.

### Assessment Results

Based on **TEST-DEPRECATION-ASSESSMENT.md** analysis of 97 test files:

- üü¢ **KEEP (40%)**: Canvas-specific, shared components, accessibility tests
- üü° **REFACTOR (35%)**: Integration tests, user journeys, performance benchmarks
- üî¥ **DEPRECATE (25%)**: Traditional sections, scroll navigation patterns

### Migration Timeline

#### **Phase 2 (Current)**: Selective Deprecation
- [x] Mark traditional section tests as `@deprecated`
- [x] Document migration assessment (TEST-DEPRECATION-ASSESSMENT.md)
- [x] Establish enhanced testing strategy (TESTING-STRATEGY.md)
- [ ] **TODO:** Add deprecation annotations to identified test files
- [ ] **TODO:** Configure parallel test execution (canvas + traditional modes)

#### **Phase 3**: Bulk Migration
- [ ] Migrate integration tests to canvas patterns
- [ ] Update user journey tests for 2D navigation
- [ ] Deprecate traditional-only E2E tests
- [ ] Establish canvas-specific performance benchmarks

#### **Phase 4**: Final Cleanup
- [ ] Delete deprecated test files
- [ ] Optimize canvas test suite performance
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines for canvas-only testing
- [ ] Archive traditional system test documentation

### Critical Actions Required

1. **Immediate (Phase 2)**:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * @deprecated - Traditional layout system
    * Will be removed in Phase 3 when canvas layout is complete
    * See: TEST-DEPRECATION-ASSESSMENT.md for migration strategy
    */
   describe('Traditional Game Flow Sections', () => {
     // ... existing tests
   });
   ```

2. **CursorLens Integration Priority**:
   - Task 6 (CursorLens Canvas Integration) is **critical blocker**
   - 91% test success rate must be maintained during canvas integration
   - Zero-occlusion behavior validation required

3. **Performance Testing Updates**:
   - Canvas-specific FPS benchmarks (60fps requirement)
   - Mobile touch gesture test coverage
   - Cross-browser canvas compatibility validation

### Quality Gates

- ‚úÖ All `üü¢ KEEP` tests continue passing throughout transition
- üìã Canvas functionality achieves parity with traditional system
- üìã Performance benchmarks improve or maintain with canvas system
- ‚úÖ Accessibility compliance maintained across both modes
- üìã >90% test coverage maintained through transition

**Next Steps**: Execute Phase 2 immediate actions, focusing on CursorLens integration completion and systematic test deprecation annotations.

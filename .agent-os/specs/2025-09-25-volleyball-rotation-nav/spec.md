# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Volleyball Rotation Navigation System
> Created: 2025-09-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Replace the current floating navigation system with an innovative volleyball court position-based navigation interface that maps website sections to volleyball court positions (1-6). This system will provide an intuitive, sports-themed navigation experience that reinforces Nino's athletic background while maintaining professional presentation and accessibility standards.

The volleyball rotation navigation will serve as both a functional navigation tool and a subtle demonstration of creative UI/UX thinking, differentiating the portfolio from conventional navigation patterns while remaining intuitive for users.

## User Stories

### Primary Navigation Stories

**US-01: Direct Position Navigation**
- **As a** portfolio visitor
- **I want to** click on volleyball court positions (1-6) to navigate to corresponding website sections
- **So that** I can quickly access specific content areas through an intuitive sports-themed interface

*Acceptance Criteria (EARS):*
- **Given** the volleyball court interface is displayed
- **When** I click on position 1 (serving position)
- **Then** the page smoothly scrolls to the Hero/About section
- **And** the clicked position is visually highlighted as active
- **And** the scroll spy system updates to reflect the current section

**US-02: Rotation Controls**
- **As a** portfolio visitor familiar with volleyball rotations
- **I want to** use clockwise/counterclockwise rotation controls to navigate through sections sequentially
- **So that** I can explore the portfolio in a natural volleyball rotation flow

*Acceptance Criteria (EARS):*
- **Given** I am viewing any section of the portfolio
- **When** I click the clockwise rotation control
- **Then** the navigation advances to the next position in volleyball rotation order (1→2→3→4→5→6→1)
- **And** the page scrolls to the corresponding section
- **And** the active position indicator updates accordingly

**US-03: Scroll Synchronization**
- **As a** portfolio visitor
- **I want to** see the volleyball positions automatically update as I scroll through the page
- **So that** the navigation always reflects my current location in the portfolio

*Acceptance Criteria (EARS):*
- **Given** I am scrolling through the portfolio page
- **When** I enter a new section's viewport
- **Then** the corresponding volleyball position automatically becomes active
- **And** the position highlighting updates without animation interruption
- **And** the rotation controls remain functional

### Section Mapping Stories

**US-04: Core Section Access**
- **As a** portfolio visitor
- **I want to** access the six main portfolio sections through volleyball positions
- **So that** I can explore Nino's professional content through an organized, memorable navigation system

*Section Mapping:*
- Position 1 (Serving): Hero/About section
- Position 2 (Right Side): Experience section
- Position 3 (Right Front): Projects section
- Position 4 (Middle Front): Skills section
- Position 5 (Left Front): Photography section
- Position 6 (Left Side): Technologies section

*Acceptance Criteria (EARS):*
- **Given** any volleyball position is clicked
- **When** the navigation executes
- **Then** I arrive at the correct corresponding section
- **And** the section content is fully visible in the viewport
- **And** the URL hash updates to reflect the current section

**US-05: Special Navigation Handling**
- **As a** portfolio visitor
- **I want to** access special content (volleyball demo, contact) through dedicated controls
- **So that** I can reach all portfolio content while maintaining the volleyball court metaphor

*Acceptance Criteria (EARS):*
- **Given** I am viewing Position 4 (Skills section)
- **When** I activate the volleyball demo trigger
- **Then** the volleyball timing demo modal opens
- **And** the underlying navigation remains functional
- **And** the modal can be closed to return to normal navigation

- **Given** I want to access contact information
- **When** I click the "Bench" control
- **Then** the contact section/modal opens
- **And** the navigation state is preserved

### Mobile Experience Stories

**US-06: Mobile Navigation Adaptation**
- **As a** mobile portfolio visitor
- **I want to** use a simplified volleyball navigation interface optimized for touch interaction
- **So that** I can navigate effectively on smaller screens without losing the volleyball theme

*Acceptance Criteria (EARS):*
- **Given** I am viewing the portfolio on a mobile device (< 768px width)
- **When** the volleyball navigation renders
- **Then** it displays a compact court layout with larger touch targets
- **And** position labels are clearly visible
- **And** rotation controls are easily accessible with thumb navigation
- **And** all functionality remains available

### Accessibility Stories

**US-07: Keyboard Navigation Support**
- **As a** portfolio visitor using keyboard navigation
- **I want to** navigate through volleyball positions using standard keyboard controls
- **So that** I can access all content regardless of input method

*Acceptance Criteria (EARS):*
- **Given** I am navigating with keyboard only
- **When** I tab to the volleyball navigation
- **Then** I can move between positions using arrow keys
- **And** I can activate positions using Enter/Space
- **And** rotation controls are accessible via keyboard
- **And** focus indicators are clearly visible

**US-08: Screen Reader Compatibility**
- **As a** portfolio visitor using screen reading technology
- **I want to** understand the volleyball navigation system through descriptive labels
- **So that** I can navigate the portfolio effectively despite the visual metaphor

*Acceptance Criteria (EARS):*
- **Given** I am using a screen reader
- **When** I encounter volleyball positions
- **Then** each position announces its number, corresponding section, and current state
- **And** rotation controls are clearly labeled with their function
- **And** the overall navigation purpose is explained
- **And** all ARIA labels follow established patterns

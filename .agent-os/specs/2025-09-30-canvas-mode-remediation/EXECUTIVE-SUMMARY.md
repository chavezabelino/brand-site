# Canvas Mode Remediation - Executive Summary

> **Date:** 2025-09-30
> **Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Feature Non-Functional
> **Impact:** High - Core product feature broken
> **Effort:** 2 weeks (42 hours estimated)

## TL;DR

**Canvas mode doesn't work.** It was marked "complete" without being tested. User clicked the Canvas toggle and got a blank screen with errors. Investigation revealed systemic React hooks architecture issues causing infinite render loops. Complete remediation plan created.

**Fix: 12 tasks, 2 weeks, systematic React hooks refactoring required.**

---

## What Happened

### Discovery Timeline

**September 30, 2025, 8:00 PM:**
- User navigates to canvas mode for first time
- Screen shows instructions but no interactive content
- User tries click-and-hold activation
- Console floods with "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- Something appears briefly off-screen then disappears
- Attempted fixes break traditional mode too

**8:00 PM - 10:30 PM:**
- Multiple debugging attempts
- Discovered circular hook dependencies
- Found unmemoized hook returns
- Identified over-coupled useEffect dependencies
- Attempted various fixes, all failed
- Eventually reverted all changes
- Documented root causes

### Root Cause

**The Big Picture:**
Phase 2 was marked "100% complete" based on:
- ✅ Unit tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compiling
- ✅ No console errors during development
- ✅ "Evidence-based validation" document

**What Was Missing:**
- ❌ Never opened canvas mode in browser
- ❌ Never clicked the activation button
- ❌ Never saw if it actually worked
- ❌ Manual end-to-end testing skipped
- ❌ Integration broken despite unit tests passing

**Why It Happened:**
1. Validation done by analyzing code/tests, not using the feature
2. Unit tests mocked away the integration issues
3. No manual testing protocol
4. Tight deadlines led to marking tasks complete prematurely
5. "Evidence-based" validation gave false confidence

## The Technical Issues

### Issue #1: Circular Dependencies (CRITICAL)
```
useCursorTracking → useUnifiedPerformance → creates new object
→ useCursorTracking sees new dependency → re-runs → repeat forever
```

**Impact:** Infinite render loop, "Maximum update depth exceeded"

### Issue #2: Unmemoized Hook Returns (HIGH)
```typescript
// Every render creates new object reference
return {
  state: someState,
  actions: {  // New object every time!
    action1,
    action2
  }
};
```

**Impact:** Components re-render infinitely, performance tanks
**Affected:** 6 custom hooks across codebase

### Issue #3: Pointer Events Catch-22 (CRITICAL)
```typescript
pointerEvents: lensActivation.isActive ? 'auto' : 'none'
```

**Impact:** Can't click when inactive → can't activate → can't click
**User sees:** Click does nothing, lens never activates

### Issue #4: Missing Cursor Position (HIGH)
```
Lens activates → tries to show menu → cursor position is null → crashes
```

**Impact:** "CursorLens: Active but no cursor position!" warning, menu doesn't appear

### Issue #5: Over-Coupled Effects (HIGH)
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Complex logic
}, [entireObject]); // Re-runs on ANY property change
```

**Impact:** Effects run too frequently, performance degradation

## The Fix

### Comprehensive Remediation Spec

**Location:** `.agent-os/specs/2025-09-30-canvas-mode-remediation/`

**Includes:**
- 50-page detailed specification
- Root cause analysis for each issue
- Step-by-step solution patterns
- Code examples (before/after)
- 12-task implementation plan
- Manual testing protocol
- Performance validation criteria
- Documentation requirements

### Task Breakdown

**Phase 1: Foundation Fixes** (Week 1, 22 hours)
1. Fix useCursorTracking hook (4h)
2. Fix UnifiedGameFlowContext (6h)
3. Fix CursorLens component (8h)
4. Fix context helper hooks (4h)

**Phase 2: Hook Memoization** (Week 1, 8 hours)
5. Fix useAccessibility (2h)

9. Update runtime error detection (3h)
10. Manual testing protocol (4h)
11. Performance validation (2h)
12. Documentation (3h)

**Total: 42 hours estimated**

### Key Patterns to Apply

**Pattern 1: Memoize All Hook Returns**
```typescript
export const useExample = () => {
  const value = useCallback(() => {}, [deps]);

  return useMemo(() => ({
    state: someState,
    actions: { value }
  }), [someState, value]);
};
```

**Pattern 2: Fix Pointer Events**
```typescript
pointerEvents: 'auto'  // Always enable
```

**Pattern 3: Capture Initial Position**
```typescript
const handleMouseDown = (event) => {
  currentPositionRef.current = {
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY
  };
  // Immediately available for activation
};
```

**Pattern 4: Ref-Based Initialization**
```typescript
const prevValueRef = useRef(!value); // Opposite!

useEffect(() => {
  if (value !== prevValueRef.current) {
    // Runs on mount when value=true
  }
}, [value]);
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Work
- [ ] Canvas mode renders instruction overlay
- [ ] Click-and-hold (300ms) activates radial menu
- [ ] Menu appears centered at cursor position
- [ ] All 6 section buttons visible and clickable
- [ ] Clicking section navigates correctly
- [ ] Traditional mode still works

### Must Not Happen
- [ ] Zero "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- [ ] Zero infinite render loops
- [ ] Zero console warnings about dependencies
- [ ] Zero memory leaks

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] 60fps cursor tracking
- [ ] <100ms activation latency
- [ ] Bundle size increase <5KB

## Impact & Lessons

### What This Means

**For the Project:**
- Canvas mode is a core product differentiator
- Photographer metaphor incomplete without it
- Blocks alpha completion
- Undermines confidence in "complete" features

**For Development Process:**
- Validation process was insufficient
- Need mandatory manual testing
- Unit tests alone don't prove functionality
- "Evidence-based" validation needs actual usage

### Lessons Learned

1. **Unit Tests ≠ Working Feature**
   - Tests can pass while feature is broken
   - Need end-to-end integration testing
   - Manual testing is mandatory

2. **React Hooks Architecture is Critical**
   - Memoization is not optional
   - Circular dependencies are easy to create
   - Must validate hook patterns systematically

3. **Validation Must Include Usage**
   - Looking at code/tests isn't enough
   - Must actually use the feature in browser
   - Manual testing protocol required

4. **"Complete" Requires Verification**
   - Don't mark tasks done without proof
   - Functional verification is minimum bar
   - User testing reveals real issues

5. **Runtime Error Detection is Essential**
   - Now have framework to catch infinite loops
   - Should have been used during Phase 2
   - Would have caught this immediately

### Process Improvements

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Runtime error detection framework with INFINITE_LOOP type
- ✅ Comprehensive remediation spec template
- ✅ Honest status reporting in roadmap

**To Implement:**
- [ ] Mandatory manual testing checklist before marking complete
- [ ] ESLint rules for hook memoization
- [ ] Code review checklist for React patterns
- [ ] Integration test suite requirement

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Can we just remove canvas mode?**
A: No. It's a core product differentiator and the main photographer metaphor. Traditional mode is the fallback, not the primary experience.

**Q: Why not fix it quickly with hacks?**
A: The issues are architectural. Quick fixes would create more technical debt and likely break other features. Systematic refactoring is required.

**Q: How confident are we in the 2-week estimate?**
A: High confidence. Issues are well-understood, solution patterns documented, and tasks are granular with clear acceptance criteria.

**Q: What if we discover more issues?**
A: The comprehensive testing protocol (Task 10) will catch additional issues. The spec includes contingency in the estimates.

**Q: Will this break anything else?**
A: Changes are isolated to hook internals with stable external APIs. Incremental testing after each task minimizes risk. Git checkpoints provide rollback.

**Q: When can canvas mode be marked complete?**
A: After all 12 tasks pass acceptance criteria and manual testing protocol shows 100% success rate with zero console errors.

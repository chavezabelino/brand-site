- Create blur shader effect with 0-8px range using CSS backdrop-filter
- Add smooth focus transitions with easing curves

#### Task 2.3: Create Shutter Click Mechanism
- Implement click capture with visual feedback animations
- Add shutter sound effect trigger and click state management
- Create capture animation with flash effect and viewfinder shake

#### Task 2.4: Add EXIF Metadata Display

### Phase 4: Validation & Deployment

#### Task 4.1: Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Test backdrop-filter support and fallbacks for older browsers
- Verify performance across different devices and screen sizes
- Implement progressive enhancement for unsupported features

#### Task 4.2: User Experience Validation
- Test viewfinder responsiveness and visual feedback
- Validate EXIF display readability and positioning
- Verify smooth animations and transition timing

#### Task 4.3: Production Optimization
- Bundle size optimization for viewfinder components

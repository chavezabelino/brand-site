# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Cursor-Following Viewfinder Hero Interface
> Created: 2025-09-24
> Status: Approved

## Overview

Transform the hero section into a cursor-following camera viewfinder interface that creates an immersive "looking through Nino's eyes" experience. Users control a crosshair that follows their cursor movement with natural eye-tracking delay, revealing focused content while blurring surrounding areas, culminating in a satisfying click-to-capture shutter effect that crystallizes the entire interface into sharp focus.

## User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

### Cursor-Following Viewfinder System

As a **technology decision maker**, I want to **control a viewfinder crosshair with my cursor** so that **I experience an immersive camera interface that demonstrates Nino's attention to detail and technical precision**.

**Workflow:**

1. User lands on hero section and sees viewfinder overlay with crosshair
2. Crosshair follows cursor movement with natural human eye tracking delay
3. Content within crosshair focus ring appears sharp, outside content is blurred
4. EXIF-style metadata updates based on what's currently in focus
5. User clicks anywhere to trigger camera shutter effect
6. Shutter animation plays and entire interface snaps into sharp focus

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **WHEN** user moves cursor, **THEN** crosshair **SHALL** follow with 100ms delay to simulate natural eye movement
2. **IF** user has reduced motion preferences, **THEN** system **SHALL** display static centered viewfinder without cursor tracking
3. **WHEN** crosshair moves over different content areas, **THEN** focus ring **SHALL** highlight that content within 150ms
4. **WHEN** user moves cursor rapidly, **THEN** crosshair movement **SHALL** smooth out with easing function to prevent jarring motion

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Crosshair follows cursor smoothly with natural human-like delay
- [ ] Focus ring creates clear visual hierarchy between focused and unfocused content
- [ ] Performance maintains 60fps during cursor movement
- [ ] Reduced motion accessibility respected with static fallback

### Dynamic Focus and Blur System

As a **potential client**, I want to **see content come into focus as I move my cursor** so that **I understand I'm experiencing a professional photography interface that showcases dual expertise**.

**Workflow:**

1. User moves cursor around hero section
2. Content within focus ring (approximately 200px radius) appears sharp
3. Content outside focus area progressively blurs based on distance from crosshair
4. Technical content shows React/TypeScript metadata when focused
5. Photography content shows camera equipment metadata when focused
6. Background elements blur more intensely than foreground elements for depth

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **WHEN** content enters focus ring, **THEN** blur effect **SHALL** reduce to 0px within 200ms using smooth transition
2. **IF** content is outside focus ring, **THEN** blur intensity **SHALL** increase proportionally to distance (max 8px blur)
3. **WHEN** crosshair hovers over technical content, **THEN** metadata **SHALL** display "React 19.1.1, TypeScript, Enterprise Architecture"
4. **WHEN** crosshair hovers over photography content, **THEN** metadata **SHALL** switch to "Canon R5, 24-70mm f/2.8, Action Sports Photography"

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Blur effects transition smoothly without performance impact
- [ ] Focus ring clearly indicates what content is "in focus"
- [ ] Metadata context switching works reliably
- [ ] Depth-of-field effect creates realistic camera-like experience

### Shutter Click Capture Effect

As a **professional collaborator**, I want to **click to "capture" the current view** so that **I experience the satisfying conclusion of the camera metaphor and see the full hero content clearly**.

**Workflow:**

1. User positions crosshair over interesting content area
2. User clicks anywhere on hero section to trigger shutter
3. Camera shutter animation plays with realistic timing and sound (optional)
4. White flash effect briefly overlays the entire hero section
5. All blur effects disappear, revealing entire hero content in sharp focus
6. Viewfinder overlay fades out, transitioning to standard hero section
7. "Photo captured" message appears briefly in metadata area

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **WHEN** user clicks anywhere in hero section, **THEN** shutter animation **SHALL** play within 50ms of click event
2. **IF** shutter is triggered, **THEN** white flash overlay **SHALL** appear for exactly 100ms before fading
3. **WHEN** shutter completes, **THEN** all blur effects **SHALL** animate to 0px over 300ms duration
4. **WHEN** capture is complete, **THEN** viewfinder overlay **SHALL** fade out over 500ms revealing standard hero content
5. **IF** user has reduced motion preferences, **THEN** shutter effect **SHALL** use opacity changes instead of flash animation

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Shutter animation feels authentic and satisfying
- [ ] White flash effect is brief and not jarring
- [ ] Blur removal animation is smooth and complete
- [ ] Viewfinder fade-out transitions naturally to standard hero
- [ ] Accessibility considerations prevent seizure triggers

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases

1. **Rapid cursor movement** - Crosshair movement shall smooth out erratic motion with easing functions
2. **Cursor leaves viewport** - Crosshair shall remain at last known position, focus ring shall fade out after 2 seconds
3. **Touch devices without cursor** - Interface shall center focus ring with tap-to-move functionality
4. **Very slow devices** - Focus effects shall degrade gracefully, removing blur effects if frame rate drops below 30fps
5. **Multiple rapid clicks** - Shutter effect shall queue maximum 1 trigger, ignoring subsequent clicks during animation

### Technical Constraints

- **Performance:** Cursor tracking throttled to 60fps (16ms), blur effects optimized with CSS filters
- **Size Budget:** All new assets (crosshair SVG, shutter sound) under 25KB total
- **Browser Support:** Fallback to static viewfinder for browsers without CSS filter support
- **Accessibility:** Full keyboard navigation alternative, screen reader descriptions for visual effects

### User Experience Constraints

- **Motion Sensitivity:** Complete static fallback respects prefers-reduced-motion setting
- **Battery Life:** Cursor tracking pauses when hero section is out of viewport
- **Touch Accessibility:** Touch interface provides tap-to-focus equivalent experience
- **Cognitive Load:** Clear visual cues indicate interactive elements and current focus state

## Spec Scope

1. **Cursor-Following Crosshair Component** - Smooth tracking crosshair with natural human eye movement delay
2. **Dynamic Focus Ring System** - Real-time blur/focus effects based on cursor position
3. **Contextual EXIF Metadata** - Technical and photography information that updates based on focused content
4. **Camera Shutter Animation** - Click-to-capture effect with flash, sound, and blur removal
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Static viewfinder fallback for accessibility and performance
6. **Mobile Touch Adaptation** - Touch-friendly version with tap-to-focus functionality

## Out of Scope

- Multiple focus points or multi-touch support
- Video recording simulation beyond still capture
- Complex camera settings simulation (ISO, aperture adjustment)
- Integration with device camera API
- Persistent capture gallery or image saving functionality
- Sound effects for continuous focus adjustments (only shutter sound)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Immersive Camera Experience** - Hero section becomes interactive viewfinder that users control with natural cursor movement
2. **Satisfying Interaction Conclusion** - Shutter effect provides clear completion of camera metaphor experience
3. **Award-Winning Distinctiveness** - Interface creates memorable, shareable experience that demonstrates technical and creative expertise
4. **Performance Excellence** - All interactions maintain 60fps while respecting accessibility and battery considerations

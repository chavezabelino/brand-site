> Spec: Design Token System - Athletic-Inspired Foundation
> Created: 2025-09-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive design token system that establishes athletic-inspired color palettes and sports-specific motion timing to create a systematic foundation for the portfolio's "aggressively non-template" brand experience. This system will standardize visual and interactive elements while maintaining performance targets and accessibility compliance.

## User Stories

### 1. Token Implementation Story

**As a** developer building components
**I want** access to systematic athletic design tokens
**So that** I can create consistent interfaces aligned with the volleyball/sports theme

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format):**
- **Event:** When implementing new UI components
- **Action:** System provides access to standardized athletic color and timing tokens
- **Result:** Components automatically inherit consistent sports-inspired design values
- **Success:** All new components use token-based styling with zero hardcoded values

### 2. Color System Integration Story

**As a** user experiencing the portfolio
**I want** to see a cohesive athletic color palette
**So that** the professional brand feels authentic to the sports photography context

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format):**
- **Event:** When navigating through portfolio sections
- **Action:** Athletic color palette displays consistently across all interactions
- **Result:** Court-navy, court-orange, and brand-violet create unified sports aesthetic
- **Success:** Color harmony validates at AAA accessibility level with 7:1+ contrast ratios

### 3. Motion Consistency Story

**As a** user interacting with animations
**I want** smooth sports-inspired timing that reflects athletic precision
**So that** interactions feel responsive and purposeful

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format):**
- **Event:** When triggering component animations
- **Action:** Sports-specific timing (120ms/220ms/90ms/160ms) governs all transitions
- **Result:** Motion feels athletic and precise, matching volleyball timing rhythms
- **Success:** All animations complete within performance budgets (<16ms frame time)

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Performance Impact Constraints
- Token changes must not increase bundle size beyond current 85KB limit
- CSS custom property updates must complete within 16ms frame budget
- Color calculations must not block main thread execution

### Accessibility Compliance Requirements
- All color combinations must maintain WCAG AAA contrast ratios (7:1+)
- Motion tokens must respect `prefers-reduced-motion` system preferences
- High contrast mode compatibility required for all athletic colors

### Backward Compatibility Constraints
- Existing component styles must not break during token implementation
- Gradual migration path required for hardcoded values
- Fallback values mandatory for non-supporting browsers

### Browser Support Requirements
- CSS custom properties support required (IE11+ excluded)
- JavaScript token access must work in Safari 12+
- Motion timing must degrade gracefully in low-performance environments

### Bundle Size Optimization
- Token definitions must use tree-shaking compatible exports
- Unused color values must be eliminated at build time
- TypeScript definitions must not increase runtime bundle

## Spec Scope

### 1. Athletic Color Palette Integration
- **Court-Navy**: Primary brand foundation (#1e293b equivalent)
- **Court-Orange**: Energy accent color for CTAs and highlights
- **Brand-Violet**: Sophisticated accent maintaining current violet-400 usage
- **Supporting Neutrals**: Gray scale optimized for sports photography contrast
- **Semantic Colors**: Success, warning, error states with athletic inspiration

### 2. Sports-Specific Motion Timing System
- **Quick Snap**: 120ms for immediate feedback (button presses, hovers)
- **Athletic Flow**: 220ms for section transitions and major state changes
- **Precision Cut**: 90ms for micro-interactions (checkbox toggles, input focus)
- **Power Movement**: 160ms for modal appearances and content reveals
- **Easing Functions**: Custom cubic-bezier curves reflecting sports movement

### 3. Tailwind Configuration Integration
- Extend existing theme without breaking current utilities
- Custom color definitions mapped to athletic palette
- Animation duration classes for sports timing values
- Responsive breakpoints maintained for current layout

### 4. TypeScript Constants Integration
- Strongly typed color token exports for programmatic access
- Motion timing constants with JSDoc descriptions
- Theme object structure matching CSS custom properties
- Runtime type checking for token usage validation

### 5. CSS Custom Properties System
- Root-level custom properties for dynamic theming
- Scoped properties for component-specific overrides
- Cascade-friendly naming convention (--athletic-color-*)
- System preference integration for reduced motion

## Out of Scope

### Design System Expansion
- Component library creation beyond current needs
- Icon system implementation
- Typography scale redefinition (current system working well)

### Advanced Theming Features
- Dark mode implementation (not required for professional portfolio)
- User-customizable themes
- Seasonal color variations

### Complex Animation Systems
- Gesture-based animations
- Physics-based motion
- 3D transform animations

## Expected Deliverable

### Browser-Testable Color Implementations
- All athletic colors rendering correctly across target browsers
- Color contrast validation tools integrated into development workflow
- Visual regression tests for color consistency

### Animation Timing Validation
- Performance profiling tools confirming <16ms frame times
- Reduced motion preference respect verification
- Cross-browser timing consistency testing

### Accessibility Compliance Verification
- WCAG AAA contrast ratio validation for all color combinations
- Keyboard navigation compatibility with new motion timing
- Screen reader compatibility with dynamic color changes

### Performance Benchmarks Maintenance
- Bundle size analysis confirming no regression beyond 85KB limit
- Runtime performance metrics for token lookup operations
- Memory usage profiling for CSS custom property updates

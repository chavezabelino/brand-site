## Quality Gates (ENHANCED WITH ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION)

Before moving to next phase:

- [x] All current phase tasks completed with architecture improvements (Tasks 1-14 Complete)
- [x] Tests passing for enhanced functionality AND refactored components
- [x] Performance requirements met (60fps canvas operations) with monitoring overhead < 2%
- [x] No orphaned or incomplete code remains, all extracted components tested
- [x] Documentation updated for all enhancements AND architecture changes (18 documentation files created)
- [x] Canvas system integrates seamlessly with existing portfolio navigation
- [x] **ARCHITECTURE QUALITY GATES:**
  - [x] Component complexity metrics: Cyclomatic complexity < 10 per function
  - [x] Component size limits: All components < 200 lines (except main containers)
  - [x] Coupling metrics: Reduced component coupling scores documented
  - [x] Memory allocation: No memory leaks detected in extracted components
  - [x] Bundle size: Each component < 15KB gzipped
  - [x] Performance impact: Refactoring improves or maintains current performance

## Cross-Cutting Architecture Concerns

### Code Quality Standards (APPLY TO ALL TASKS)

- **Complexity Metrics**: Maintain cyclomatic complexity < 10 per function across all components
- **Component Size**: Keep components under 200 lines (main containers can be larger if well-structured)
- **Hook Complexity**: Limit custom hooks to single responsibility and < 50 lines
- **Type Safety**: Implement strict TypeScript configurations with no `any` types
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error boundaries and recovery strategies
- **Performance**: Maintain < 16ms render time for all components during task implementation

### Architecture Validation (CONTINUOUS MONITORING)

- **Dependency Analysis**: Ensure proper dependency direction (UI → Services → Utilities)
- **Coupling Metrics**: Measure and reduce component coupling scores after refactoring
- **Cohesion Validation**: Ensure high cohesion within extracted components
- **Interface Segregation**: Create focused interfaces for each component responsibility
- **Single Responsibility**: Validate each component has single, well-defined responsibility
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Ensure components are open for extension, closed for modification

### Performance Benchmarks (CONTINUOUS VALIDATION)

- **Bundle Size**: Maintain < 15KB gzipped per component after extraction
- **Memory Usage**: Track memory allocation in extracted components (baseline + delta)
- **Render Performance**: Validate < 16ms render time for all components
- **Animation Smoothness**: Ensure 60fps during all canvas operations
- **State Update Performance**: Batch updates maintain < 5ms update cycles
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Performance monitoring impact < 2% of measured operations

### Architecture Smell Detection (CONTINUOUS MONITORING)

- **God Component Detection**: Alert if any component exceeds 300 lines
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Automated detection of circular dependencies
- **Unused Code Detection**: Regular cleanup of unused imports and dead code
- **Complex Memoization Detection**: Alert if memoization dependencies exceed 5 items
- **Effect Complexity Detection**: Alert if useEffect has > 3 dependencies
- **State Complexity Detection**: Alert if state nesting exceeds 3 levels

### Refactoring Success Metrics (MEASURE THROUGHOUT IMPLEMENTATION)

- **Component Count**: Track increase in focused components vs. decrease in complexity
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain or improve test coverage after component extraction
- **Performance Improvement**: Measure performance before/after refactoring
- **Code Maintainability**: Improved readability and maintainability scores
- **Bug Reduction**: Reduced bug reports related to extracted component responsibilities
- **Developer Experience**: Improved development velocity and debugging capability

## Implementation Notes

**Foundation Recognition:**

- Comprehensive LightboxCanvas and SpatialSection components already exist
- Complete performance monitoring and coordinate transform infrastructure in place
- Extensive testing suite with 60+ canvas-related tests already implemented
- Full state management integration with UnifiedGameFlowContext established

**Enhancement Focus:**

- Tasks focus on optimization, refinement, and specification compliance
- Documentation tasks ensure comprehensive developer and user guidance
- Integration tasks optimize existing system coordination
- Performance tasks validate and enhance existing monitoring infrastructure

**Production Readiness:**

- All tasks build toward production deployment of enhanced canvas system
- Quality gates ensure each phase contributes to production-ready functionality
- Documentation tasks provide comprehensive implementation and usage guidance
- Testing tasks validate specification compliance and edge case handling

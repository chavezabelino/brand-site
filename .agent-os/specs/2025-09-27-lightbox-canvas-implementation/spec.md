> Spec: Lightbox Canvas Implementation
> Created: 2025-09-27

## Overview

Implement the core visual components (LightboxCanvas, SpatialSection) that transform the existing portfolio from traditional scroll navigation to a photographer's lightbox with 2x3 spatial grid arrangement. This implementation brings the completed architectural foundation (types, interfaces, state management) into visual reality, enabling cinematic pan/zoom navigation between the six existing portfolio sections.

## User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

### Spatial Canvas Navigation

As a **portfolio visitor**, I want to **navigate through portfolio sections using 2D spatial movement**, so that **I can experience the photographer's lightbox metaphor and intuitively explore content in a non-linear fashion**.

**Workflow:**
1. User lands on portfolio and sees the six sections arranged in a 2x3 spatial grid
2. User can pan/zoom across the canvas to view different sections at various detail levels
3. User can click or use keyboard navigation to focus on specific sections
4. System provides smooth 60fps transitions between spatial positions
5. User can return to overview or navigate to adjacent sections seamlessly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** user loads the portfolio, **THEN** system **SHALL** display all six sections in a 2x3 grid layout within 2 seconds
2. **WHEN** user performs pan/zoom gesture, **THEN** system **SHALL** maintain 60fps animation performance during transitions
3. **WHEN** user clicks on a section, **THEN** system **SHALL** smoothly focus to that section within 800ms
4. **IF** user is on mobile device, **THEN** system **SHALL** support touch pan and pinch-to-zoom gestures
5. **WHEN** accessibility mode is enabled, **THEN** system **SHALL** provide keyboard navigation (arrow keys) and screen reader announcements

**Definition of Done (Enhanced with Architecture Quality):**
- [ ] LightboxCanvas component renders 2x3 grid of portfolio sections
- [ ] Pan/zoom interactions maintain 60fps performance on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all spatial movements
- [ ] Touch gestures (pan, pinch-zoom) function correctly on mobile devices
- [ ] Screen readers announce spatial position and section content
- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE QUALITY CRITERIA:**
  - [ ] LightboxCanvas component reduced from 850 to < 200 lines
  - [ ] TouchGestureHandler component extracted and independently testable
  - [ ] AnimationController component extracted and performance optimized
  - [ ] PerformanceRenderer component extracted with < 2% overhead
  - [ ] AccessibilityController component extracted with WCAG compliance
  - [ ] Component coupling metrics show measurable improvement
  - [ ] All extracted components maintain single responsibility principle

### Section Detail Viewing

As a **portfolio visitor**, I want to **zoom into individual sections for detailed content**, so that **I can examine specific work while maintaining spatial context of the overall portfolio**.

**Workflow:**
1. User navigates to a section using pan/zoom or direct selection
2. System scales the section content appropriately for the zoom level
3. User can read detailed content, view images, and interact with section-specific elements
4. User can zoom out to see multiple sections or navigate to adjacent sections
5. System maintains visual continuity and spatial relationships throughout

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** user zooms into a section, **THEN** system **SHALL** scale content legibly while maintaining aspect ratios
2. **WHEN** section is in focus, **THEN** system **SHALL** display full content including text, images, and interactive elements
3. **IF** user zooms out beyond 50% scale, **THEN** system **SHALL** show section preview/summary content
4. **WHEN** user navigates between sections, **THEN** system **SHALL** maintain zoom level consistency across similar content types
5. **WHEN** content exceeds viewport at current zoom, **THEN** system **SHALL** provide scroll/pan within the section

**Definition of Done (Enhanced with Architecture Quality):**
- [ ] SpatialSection component scales content appropriately for different zoom levels
- [ ] Content remains legible and interactive at all supported zoom levels
- [ ] Section transitions maintain spatial continuity and user orientation
- [ ] Progressive content disclosure works (preview vs. detail based on zoom level)
- [ ] Section-internal scrolling/navigation functions correctly when content exceeds viewport
- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE QUALITY CRITERIA:**
  - [ ] ProgressiveContentRenderer component extracted with strategy pattern
  - [ ] ContentLevelManager extracted for scale threshold management
  - [ ] Progressive disclosure logic isolated and independently testable
  - [ ] Content loading performance optimized through architectural improvements
  - [ ] Design token integration optimized and standardized
  - [ ] Component complexity reduced through focused responsibilities

### Photography Metaphor Integration

As a **portfolio visitor**, I want to **experience photographer-inspired navigation interactions**, so that **the interface reinforces the creative professional's domain expertise and creates memorable engagement**.

**Workflow:**
1. User encounters camera-inspired navigation cues and visual feedback
2. System provides photography-metaphor interactions (focus, exposure, framing)
3. User experiences smooth transitions that mimic camera movements
4. Interface elements use photography terminology and visual language
5. Overall experience feels cohesive with the photography professional brand

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** user hovers over sections, **THEN** system **SHALL** apply photography-inspired visual effects (focus, depth of field)
2. **WHEN** user performs navigation, **THEN** system **SHALL** use camera movement metaphors (pan, tilt, zoom, dolly)
3. **IF** system detects slow performance, **THEN** system **SHALL** gracefully degrade effects while maintaining photography metaphor
4. **WHEN** user interacts with navigation controls, **THEN** system **SHALL** use photography terminology (focus, frame, exposure)
5. **WHEN** transitions occur, **THEN** system **SHALL** maintain cinematic quality with appropriate easing and timing

**Definition of Done (Enhanced with Architecture Quality):**
- [ ] Camera movement metaphors implemented (pan, tilt, zoom, dolly, rack focus)
- [ ] Photography-inspired visual effects applied consistently
- [ ] Navigation terminology uses photographer vocabulary
- [ ] Transitions feel cinematic and professionally crafted
- [ ] Performance degradation maintains metaphor integrity
- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE QUALITY CRITERIA:**
  - [ ] Camera movement logic isolated in AnimationController component
  - [ ] Photography metaphor patterns implemented with strategy pattern
  - [ ] Visual effects decoupled from core navigation logic
  - [ ] Performance monitoring ensures metaphor quality under load
  - [ ] Photography terminology consistently applied across components
  - [ ] Cinematic transitions maintain quality through architectural optimization

# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Phase 4 - Advanced Visual Effects & Photographic Interactions
> Created: 2025-09-30
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Overview

Enhance the existing 2D canvas lightbox system with comprehensive professional photography and cinematography visual effects that deepen the photographic metaphor while improving user experience. This phase builds upon the foundational camera movements (pan/tilt, zoom, rack focus, match cut, dolly zoom) by adding advanced effects inspired by real-world photography workflows, film production techniques, and professional editing tools.

**Philosophy:** Every effect should feel like a natural extension of working with a photographer's lightbox, examining prints, or reviewing footage on a professional editing timeline.

## User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

### Story 1: Depth-of-Field Effects

As a **portfolio visitor**, I want to **experience realistic depth-of-field effects**, so that **focused content feels natural and immersive, like examining a physical photograph**.

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases

1. **Performance degradation with multiple effects** - System shall detect cumulative performance impact and automatically disable least-critical effects to maintain 60fps
2. **Low-end device detection** - System shall detect device capabilities and gracefully reduce effect intensity or disable effects entirely
3. **Reduced motion preferences** - System shall respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query and disable motion blur, parallax, and rapid transitions
4. **Conflicting effect combinations** - System shall manage effect priority to prevent visual artifacts (e.g., blur + chromatic aberration intensity caps)
5. **Browser compatibility variations** - System shall feature-detect CSS filter support and provide fallbacks where needed

### Technical Constraints

- **Performance:** All effects must maintain 60fps; individual effects must have <5ms impact on frame time
- **Memory:** Effect systems must use <10MB additional memory for blur/shadow caching
- **Compatibility:** Must work in Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Degradation:** Effects must gracefully disable on devices with <4GB RAM or older GPUs

### User Experience Constraints

- **Accessibility:** All effects must be disablable via preferences panel; respect system accessibility settings
- **Subtlety:** Effects should enhance, not distract; maximum 20% visual change from default state
- **Cognitive Load:** No more than 3 simultaneous effects active at once to prevent overwhelming user
- **Control:** User must have keyboard shortcuts to toggle all effects on/off globally (Shift+E)

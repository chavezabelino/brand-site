- Performance impact with multiple effects (Mitigation: automatic degradation)
- Browser compatibility variations (Mitigation: feature detection + fallbacks)

**Medium Risk:**
- Effect interaction conflicts (Mitigation: priority system)
- Low-end device performance (Mitigation: capability detection)

**Low Risk:**
- User preference handling (built-in localStorage support)
- Accessibility compliance (following established patterns)

---

## Notes

- Each effect is independently toggleable
- Effects should be subtle and enhance, not distract
- Photography authenticity is key - every effect based on real technique
- Performance is non-negotiable - 60fps or auto-disable
- User control is paramount - everything can be customized or disabled

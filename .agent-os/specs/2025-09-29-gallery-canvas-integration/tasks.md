## Quality Gates

Before moving to next phase, verify:
- [ ] All current phase tasks completed
- [ ] Tests passing for implemented functionality
- [ ] Performance targets met (60fps, <500ms load, <300ms modal)
- [ ] No accessibility regressions (maintain WCAG AAA)
- [ ] Gallery integrates seamlessly with existing canvas
- [ ] No orphaned or incomplete code

---

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **ContentAdapter System:** Gallery extends progressive disclosure pattern
- **LightboxCanvas:** Gallery triggered by 'portfolio' section zoom
- **CursorLens:** Gallery accessible via radial menu navigation
- **Performance Monitoring:** Gallery metrics tracked by CanvasPerformanceMonitor
- **Touch Gestures:** Gallery integrates with existing mobile touch handlers
- **Accessibility:** Gallery maintains WCAG AAA compliance throughout

### Data Dependencies
- Gallery metadata JSON structure
- Optimized image assets (WebP + JPEG fallbacks)
- Category taxonomy (aligned with existing skill/experience categories)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- **Performance degradation:** Mitigate with aggressive lazy loading, virtual scrolling if needed
- **Mobile memory constraints:** Limit concurrent image loads, use lower quality on mobile
- **Test infrastructure memory issues:** Run gallery tests in isolation, increase heap if needed

### Medium Risk Items
- **EXIF parsing complexity:** Use battle-tested libraries, manual entry acceptable
- **WebP browser support:** Provide JPEG fallbacks, detect format support
- **Touch gesture conflicts:** Careful z-index management, prevent event propagation

# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-25-photo-sequence-display/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-25
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Dynamic Layout Engine**: Implement CSS Grid/Flexbox hybrid system that positions projects in burst-sequence patterns rather than uniform grids
- **Minimalist EXIF Overlay System**: Create hover-triggered overlays that display only project-specific performance metrics (Timeline/Shutter Speed, Complexity/Aperture, Date/ISO) to avoid redundancy with About section technical profile
- **Side-Overlay Drawer Architecture**: Build non-modal slide-out drawers that overlay from the side using CSS transforms, maintaining visibility of the main photo sequence behind
- **Photography-Inspired Animations**: Implement camera-like transitions including aperture-style circular reveals, focus-pull effects, and shutter-speed based timing
- **Responsive Sequence Adaptation**: Ensure burst-sequence layout scales from mobile (single column sequence) to desktop (multi-column dynamic positioning)
- **Performance Optimization**: Use CSS transforms and will-change properties for smooth animations, implement intersection observer for lazy-loading project details
- **Athletic Token Integration**: Leverage existing athletic design tokens for consistent typography, spacing, and color schemes while adding photography-specific token extensions
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure WCAG compliance with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation through project sequences, and reduced-motion preferences for animations
- **State Management**: Track expanded/collapsed panel states, hover interactions, and active project focus for seamless user experience
- **Content Structure Integration**: Work with existing project data structure from constants.ts while extending to support new photography metadata fields

## Approach

### Layout System Implementation
- Use CSS Grid for main container with dynamic column sizing based on viewport
- Implement Flexbox for individual project card positioning within grid cells
- Create staggered positioning algorithm that mimics camera burst sequence timing
- Use CSS custom properties for dynamic spacing and positioning calculations

### Minimalist EXIF Overlay System
- Create lightweight MetadataOverlay component focusing only on project-specific metrics
- Map performance data to camera terminology (Timeline → Shutter Speed, Complexity → Aperture, Date → ISO)
- Implement hover state management using React hooks (useState, useCallback)
- Design overlay positioning system that avoids viewport edge overflow
- Exclude technical stack details to prevent redundancy with About section

### Side-Overlay Drawer System
- Build non-modal slide-out drawer components using CSS transforms (translateX)
- Implement backdrop overlay with reduced opacity to maintain sequence visibility
- Create smooth slide animations from left or right side of viewport
- Design drawer width to preserve 30-40% visibility of main photo sequence
- Add close triggers (ESC key, click outside, explicit close button) for seamless UX

### Animation Framework
- Build custom CSS animation library with photography-inspired keyframes
- Create timing functions that match camera shutter speeds and focus-pull mechanics
- Implement drawer slide animations with performance-optimized transform properties
- Use IntersectionObserver API for performance-optimized lazy loading

### Responsive Design Strategy
- Mobile-first approach with single column sequence layout
- Progressive enhancement to multi-column dynamic positioning on larger screens
- Breakpoint system that aligns with existing athletic design tokens
- Touch-friendly interaction targets for mobile hover equivalents

## External Dependencies

### New Dependencies Required
- **framer-motion** (v10.x): For advanced photography-inspired animations and transitions
- **react-intersection-observer** (v9.x): For performance-optimized lazy loading of project details
- **react-use-gesture** (v10.x): For touch and gesture handling on mobile devices

### Existing Dependencies Leveraged
- **React 19.1.1**: Core component architecture and hooks
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for new interfaces and component props
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes and existing athletic design tokens
- **Vite**: Development and build optimization

### CSS Custom Properties Extensions
- Photography timing variables (--shutter-speed-fast, --shutter-speed-slow)
- Aperture-based spacing system (--f-stop-1 through --f-stop-8)
- Focus-pull transition durations (--focus-pull-near, --focus-pull-far)
- Burst sequence positioning offsets (--burst-offset-1 through --burst-offset-5)

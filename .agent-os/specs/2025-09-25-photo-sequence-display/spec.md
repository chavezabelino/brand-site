# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Photo Sequence Project Display
> Created: 2025-09-25

## Overview

Transform the project showcase from a traditional grid layout into a dynamic burst-mode photography sequence with EXIF-style metadata overlays. This feature will create a unique, photography-inspired way to display projects that aligns with the site's "moment of impact" theme and demonstrates technical expertise through camera-inspired interactions.

## User Stories

### Professional Photography Experience

As a potential client or collaborator, I want to explore projects in a photography-inspired interface, so that I can experience Nino's work through the lens of his dual expertise in technology and action sports photography.

Users will encounter projects displayed like frames from a burst-mode camera sequence, with each project representing a "shot" in the sequence. Hovering over projects reveals minimalist EXIF-style performance metrics (Timeline/Shutter Speed, Complexity/Aperture, Date/ISO), and clicking triggers fast, non-modal slide-out drawers that reveal detailed architectural rationale while keeping the main sequence visible in the background.

### Technical Deep-Dive Access

As a technical professional, I want to access detailed architectural information for each project, so that I can understand the technical complexity and decision-making process behind Nino's work.

The slide-out "Behind the Shot" drawers provide comprehensive technical explanations, architectural rationale, and implementation details for each project, demonstrating both technical depth and the ability to communicate complex concepts clearly. These drawers maintain continuous scroll flow by overlaying from the side while preserving the context of the main photo sequence.

## Spec Scope

1. **Burst Mode Layout System** - Replace grid-based project display with dynamic, photography-inspired positioning that mimics camera burst sequences
2. **Minimalist EXIF Overlays** - Implement streamlined camera-style overlays on hover, focusing only on project-specific performance metrics (Timeline/Shutter Speed, Complexity/Aperture, Date/ISO) to avoid redundancy with About section technical profile
3. **Behind the Shot Slide-Out Drawers** - Create fast, non-modal slide-out drawers that overlay from the side, revealing comprehensive architectural rationale while keeping the main photo sequence visible in the background
4. **Photography-Inspired Interactions** - Design hover states, transitions, and animations that mirror professional photography software interfaces
5. **Responsive Sequence Display** - Ensure the burst sequence layout adapts elegantly across all screen sizes while maintaining the photography aesthetic

## Out of Scope

- Traditional grid or card-based layout systems
- Generic project display patterns that don't align with the photography theme
- Complex photo editing interface elements that would distract from content
- Video playback or advanced media features beyond static project showcases
- Full-screen modals or panels that break continuous scroll flow
- Redundant technical stack information already covered in the About section

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Dynamic Project Sequence** - A visually engaging burst-mode layout that displays projects as photography frames with smooth transitions and professional animations
2. **Minimalist Performance Metrics** - Hover-triggered EXIF-style overlays showing only project-specific metrics (Timeline/Shutter Speed, Complexity/Aperture, Date/ISO) without redundant technical stack details
3. **Non-Modal Slide-Out Drawers** - Click-triggered side-overlay drawers that reveal comprehensive technical explanations and architectural rationale while maintaining visibility of the main photo sequence, preserving continuous scroll flow

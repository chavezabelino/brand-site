# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-26-cursor-lens-component/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture
- **CursorLens.tsx** - Main React component with TypeScript interfaces following existing project conventions
- **useCursorTracking.tsx** - Custom hook for high-frequency mouse position monitoring with RAF-based optimization
- **useRadialMenu.tsx** - Custom hook for menu positioning logic and viewport constraint handling
- **useLensActivation.tsx** - Custom hook for gesture detection (click-and-hold, hover) with debouncing
- **types/cursor-lens.ts** - TypeScript interface definitions for component props, state, and positioning data

### Performance Specifications
- **Cursor Tracking Frequency:** Maximum 60fps (16ms intervals) using requestAnimationFrame scheduling
- **Memory Management:** Automatic cleanup of event listeners and RAF callbacks on component unmount
- **Throttling Strategy:** Mouse move events throttled to 16ms intervals with position smoothing
- **Activation Debouncing:** Multiple rapid activations debounced to 100ms to prevent conflicts
- **Rendering Optimization:** Virtual positioning calculations cached to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Cursor Tracking System
- **Event Listeners:** Global mouse move, mouse down, mouse up event handlers attached to document
- **Position Calculation:** Real-time cursor coordinates with viewport offset normalization
- **Gesture Recognition:** Click-and-hold detection with 0ms threshold, hover detection with 800ms delay
- **Edge Detection:** Continuous monitoring of cursor proximity to viewport boundaries (40px threshold)
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Compatibility layer for different mouse event implementations

### Radial Menu Positioning Engine
- **Clockwise Section Arrangement:** 6 sections positioned at 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300° angles
- **Dynamic Center Calculation:** Menu center adjusts based on cursor position and viewport constraints
- **Smart Repositioning Algorithm:** Automatic adjustment when cursor within 40px of viewport edges
- **Collision Detection:** Prevention of menu overflow beyond viewport boundaries
- **Responsive Scaling:** Menu size adaptation for mobile/tablet viewports with touch-friendly targets

### Animation and Transitions
- **Entrance Animation:** 160ms fade-in with scale transform using athletic timing tokens (approach)
- **Exit Animation:** 220ms fade-out with scale transform using athletic timing tokens (follow-through)
- **Section Highlighting:** 16ms response time for hover states using RAF-synchronized updates
- **Repositioning Transitions:** 90ms quick-snap timing for edge constraint adjustments
- **Easing Functions:** Athletic design token easing curves for professional camera-like movement

## UI/UX Specifications

### Visual Design
- **Menu Background:** Semi-transparent backdrop with 10px blur effect using backdrop-filter
- **Section Elements:** Circular buttons with 44px minimum touch targets for accessibility
- **Color Scheme:** Court-navy primary, court-orange highlights, brand-violet accents from athletic tokens
- **Typography:** Inter font family with monospace for camera metadata labels
- **Iconography:** Custom SVG camera icons (aperture rings, focus indicators) for each section

### Interaction States
- **Inactive State:** No visual indicator, respecting zero-occlusion principle
- **Ready State:** Subtle cursor change to crosshair when over activatable areas
- **Activating State:** Visual feedback during click-and-hold gesture recognition
- **Active State:** Full radial menu with backdrop blur and section highlighting
- **Navigation State:** Selected section emphasized during transition trigger

### Accessibility Features
- **ARIA Labels:** Each section with descriptive camera metaphor labels and current state
- **Live Regions:** Screen reader announcements for menu activation and section focus changes
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Tab-accessible alternative providing linear access to all 6 sections
- **Focus Management:** Logical focus order and visible focus indicators meeting WCAG standards
- **Reduced Motion:** Simplified animations respecting prefers-reduced-motion user preferences

## Integration Requirements

### State Management Integration
- **UnifiedGameFlowContext Connection:** Direct integration with existing global state management
- **Section Navigation Triggers:** Activation of existing photography workflow section transitions
- **Camera State Synchronization:** Coordination with current camera viewfinder state if active
- **Performance Monitoring Integration:** Real-time frame rate tracking for cursor operations

### Component Replacement Strategy
- **ViewfinderInterface Substitution:** Direct replacement of existing central navigation component
- **App.tsx Integration:** Modification of main app component to include CursorLens overlay
- **State Migration:** Preservation of existing navigation state during component swap
- **Graceful Degradation:** Fallback to traditional navigation if CursorLens initialization fails

### Mobile and Touch Support
- **Touch Event Mapping:** Long-press gesture (750ms) equivalent to click-and-hold activation
- **Haptic Feedback:** Vibration API integration for activation confirmation where available
- **Touch Target Optimization:** Increased section sizes for finger-friendly interaction
- **Gesture Library Integration:** Touch gesture recognition using existing browser touch APIs

## Performance Criteria

### Rendering Performance
- **60fps Maintenance:** Continuous 60fps during active cursor tracking and menu display
- **GPU Acceleration:** Transform3d and will-change properties for hardware acceleration
- **Bundle Size Impact:** Maximum 15KB additional gzipped JavaScript for component and hooks
- **Memory Footprint:** No memory leaks during extended usage sessions with proper cleanup

### Responsiveness Targets
- **Activation Latency:** Menu appearance within 100ms of gesture recognition
- **Section Highlighting:** Visual feedback within 16ms of cursor movement over sections
- **Navigation Trigger:** Section selection response within 50ms of release gesture
- **Cleanup Performance:** Complete event listener removal within 16ms of component unmount

## External Dependencies

### Animation Library
- **React Spring v9.7+** - Advanced spring-based animations for smooth cursor transitions
- **Justification:** Provides physics-based animations with RAF optimization and gesture coordination needed for professional camera-like movement feel

### Gesture Detection Enhancement
- **@use-gesture/react v10.3+** - Enhanced touch and mouse gesture recognition
- **Justification:** Robust cross-platform gesture detection with touch/mouse unification and precise timing control required for complex cursor interactions

### Performance Monitoring
- **react-performance-monitor v2.1+** - Real-time performance tracking for cursor operations
- **Justification:** Specialized monitoring for high-frequency operations ensuring 60fps maintenance during cursor tracking and menu display

# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-25-game-flow-redesign/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture Transformation
- **Continuous Scroll Engine**: Implement smooth, performance-optimized vertical scrolling with strategic scroll-snap points at each of the six Game Flow sections
- **Section State Management**: Build unified state system that tracks user progression through Equipment Check → Warm-Up → Game Time → Training → Action Shots → Post-Game
- **Contextual Information Architecture**: Replace persistent overlays with section-specific, contextually-triggered information reveals using intersection observers and scroll-based animations

### Game Flow Section Implementations

#### 1. Equipment Check (Hero) Redesign
- Minimize visual complexity to focus on title, role, and primary CTA
- Hide/minimize current stats and skills displays
- Implement clean, high-impact visual with performance-optimized loading
- Add subtle "View Work" call-to-action that initiates scroll journey

#### 2. Warm-Up (About) Integration
- **Remove Technical Profile Overlay**: Eliminate the current floating technical profile box
- **Integrated Stats Card**: Animate technical profile data into view as user scrolls into About section
- **Progressive Revelation**: Technical stack, focus areas, and experience appear contextually within the About narrative
- **Athletic Stats Metaphor**: Present credentials using sports statistics card visual language

#### 3. Game Time (Projects) Contextual Reveals
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Projects displayed in high-fidelity sequences without overwhelming technical details
- **Side-Panel Tech Stack**: Clicking a project triggers subtle, temporary side-panel revealing project-specific technical stack
- **Contextual Relevance**: Technical information appears only when user explicitly requests it for specific project
- **Non-Modal Approach**: Side panels maintain visibility of main project sequence

#### 4. Training (Insights) Flow Integration
- **Training Log Aesthetic**: Style insights/articles section like an athletic training log
- **Clean Typography Focus**: Emphasize scannability and readability
- **Camera-Shutter Transitions**: Subtle shutter-like transition effects between article previews
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure instant loading and smooth transitions

#### 5. Action Shots (Gallery) Performance Showcase
- **High-Speed Loading**: Implement optimized image loading that demonstrates technical capability
- **High-Density Display**: Maximum visual impact through efficient gallery presentation
- **Technical Authority**: Gallery performance itself becomes demonstration of optimization skills
- **Instant Responsiveness**: Zero-delay interactions that showcase technical mastery

#### 6. Post-Game (Contact) Simplification
- **Clean Completion**: Simple, direct contact form marking end of the "match"
- **Clear CTAs**: Unambiguous calls-to-action for collaboration initiation
- **Performance Consistency**: Maintain flawless performance through final section

### Camera-Inspired Micro-Interactions
- **Focus/Blur Effects**: Subtle depth-of-field changes on hover interactions
- **Shutter Flash Transitions**: Momentary camera flash effects between major sections
- **Aperture-Style Animations**: Circular reveal animations inspired by camera aperture mechanics
- **Photography Timing**: Animation durations that match camera shutter speeds and focus-pull timing

### Performance-as-Feature Architecture
- **Load Time Optimization**: Target sub-1-second initial load time as technical demonstration
- **Animation Smoothness**: 60fps micro-animations using CSS transforms and will-change properties
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure base experience works without JavaScript, enhanced with smooth interactions
- **Technical Mastery Exhibition**: Every interaction demonstrates optimization expertise through execution

### Information Disclosure System
- **High-Level Navigation Only**: Maintain clean Technical HUD navigation (HOME, ABOUT, WORK, etc.)
- **Contextual Detail Revelation**: Technical specifications appear only within appropriate narrative context
- **Attention Respect**: Eliminate persistent distractions in favor of user-initiated information access
- **Progressive Depth**: Allow users to dive deeper into technical details without overwhelming initial experience

## External Dependencies

### Animation Framework Extensions
- **Framer Motion** (v10.x): Enhanced for camera-inspired micro-interactions and section transitions
- **React Spring** (v9.x): Smooth scroll interpolation and physics-based animations
- **Lottie React** (v2.x): Custom camera-shutter and focus-pull animation assets

### Performance Monitoring
- **Web Vitals** (v3.x): Real-time performance metrics to ensure technical demonstration objectives
- **React DevTools Profiler**: Development-time performance optimization validation

### Scroll Management
- **React Intersection Observer** (v9.x): Section visibility detection and contextual content triggering
- **Smooth Scroll Behavior**: Native CSS scroll-behavior with JavaScript fallbacks for precise control

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
- Implement continuous scroll engine with section state management
- Remove existing Technical Profile overlay system
- Establish performance monitoring baseline

### Phase 2: Section Redesigns
- Redesign Hero section with minimalist focus
- Integrate About section with contextual technical profile revelation
- Implement Projects section with contextual side-panel system

### Phase 3: Micro-Interactions & Polish
- Add camera-inspired animations and transitions
- Implement shutter flash section transitions
- Optimize performance for sub-1-second load times

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
- Validate continuous narrative flow
- Performance optimization and technical demonstration validation
- Cross-device and accessibility compliance testing

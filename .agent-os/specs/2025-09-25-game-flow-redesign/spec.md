> Spec: Game Flow & Contextual UX Redesign
> Created: 2025-09-25

## Overview

Transform the Nino Chavez portfolio from a collection of well-styled components into a single, memorable digital experience that delivers "The Moment of Impact." This comprehensive redesign moves from modular presentation to a unified, narrative-driven experience where users advance through a high-stakes, high-precision event that demonstrates both technical mastery and athletic precision.

## User Stories

### The Seamless Match Experience

As a potential client or collaborator, I want to experience a fluid, single-page narrative that guides me through Nino's professional journey like a high-performance athletic event, so that I can understand his capabilities through an immersive, memorable experience rather than fragmented component interactions.

Users will encounter a continuous vertical scroll through six strategic "Game Flow" sections: Equipment Check (Hero), Warm-Up (About with integrated technical profile), Game Time (Projects with contextual reveals), Training (Insights), Action Shots (Gallery), and Post-Game (Contact). Each section flows seamlessly into the next with subtle camera-inspired transitions and contextual information disclosure.

### Performance as Demonstration

As a technical professional evaluating expertise, I want to experience flawless performance, smooth animations, and progressive disclosure of technical details, so that I can witness technical mastery through the experience itself, not just through content claims.

The redesign demonstrates technical expertise through execution - instant load times, smooth micro-animations, and contextual technical reveals that appear only when relevant, replacing obtrusive overlays with integrated, narrative-appropriate data presentation.

## Spec Scope

1. **Elimination of Obtrusive Overlays** - Remove the current "Technical Profile" floating box in favor of contextual, section-specific data reveals that respect user attention
2. **Continuous Vertical Flow Implementation** - Create a fluid, single-page scroll experience using the six rotations as strategic scroll points with seamless transitions
3. **Game Flow Section Redesign** - Restructure all six sections (Equipment Check, Warm-Up, Game Time, Training, Action Shots, Post-Game) to function as unified narrative progression
4. **Contextual Progressive Disclosure** - Implement information architecture where detailed technical data appears contextually within dedicated sections rather than as persistent overlays
5. **Camera-Inspired Micro-Interactions** - Integrate subtle focus/blur effects, shutter flash transitions, and photography-inspired animations that enhance rather than distract
6. **Performance-as-Feature Integration** - Ensure load times, animation smoothness, and interaction responsiveness demonstrate technical mastery through flawless execution

## Out of Scope

- Maintaining existing fragmented component architecture
- Persistent technical overlays that interrupt narrative flow
- Hard page breaks or section jumps that disrupt continuous experience
- Generic animation libraries that don't align with camera/athletic metaphor
- Performance compromises that undermine the technical demonstration objective

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Unified Narrative Experience** - A seamless, single-page portfolio that functions as a performance, guiding users through six strategic sections with continuous vertical flow and camera-inspired transitions
2. **Contextual Information Architecture** - Technical details and credentials revealed progressively within appropriate narrative contexts, eliminating obtrusive overlays while maintaining information accessibility
3. **Performance-Optimized Athletic Interface** - Flawless load times, smooth micro-animations, and responsive interactions that demonstrate technical mastery through execution, creating a memorable "Moment of Impact" experience

## Implementation Notes

### Dependency Management
- Task 1.1 → 1.2 → 2.1 (Foundation before visual implementation)
- Task 2.1 → 2.2 → 3.1 (Visual elements before interactions)
- Task 3.2 requires completion of Phase 2 (Integration after core features)
- Testing tasks (1.3, 2.3, 3.4) run parallel to implementation

### Quality Gates Enforcement
- Each phase must pass quality gates before proceeding
- Performance monitoring integrated throughout development
- Accessibility testing concurrent with feature development

### Risk Mitigation
- Early testing prevents integration issues
- Performance monitoring catches regressions immediately
- Incremental building ensures stable intermediate states

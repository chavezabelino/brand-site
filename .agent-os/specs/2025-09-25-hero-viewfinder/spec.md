> Spec: Hero Viewfinder Component - Frame Capture Interactive Experience
> Created: 2025-09-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create an interactive camera viewfinder hero component that combines a blur-to-focus background animation with a technical metadata HUD display and shutter capture interaction. The component will serve as the primary landing experience that showcases technical skills through a photography-inspired interface while maintaining performance targets and accessibility standards.

## User Stories

### US-001: Photographer Landing Experience
**As a** site visitor arriving at the hero section
**I want** to experience an immersive camera viewfinder interface that reveals technical skills
**So that** I can immediately understand the site owner's capabilities through an engaging interactive metaphor

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format):**
- **WHEN** the hero section enters the viewport **THEN** the background image **SHALL** animate from blurred (blur-radius: 8px) to focused (blur-radius: 0px) over 1.2 seconds using Framer Motion
- **WHEN** the focus animation completes **THEN** the viewfinder metadata HUD **SHALL** fade in displaying technical skills with staggered animations (0.1s intervals)
- **WHEN** the user hovers over skill items **THEN** the HUD elements **SHALL** highlight with athletic theme colors and subtle scale transforms
- **WHEN** all animations complete **THEN** the "Capture the Moment" button **SHALL** be fully interactive with visible focus states

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Background blur animation completes within 1.2 seconds
- [ ] All HUD metadata displays correctly with readable contrast ratios (≥ 4.5:1)
- [ ] Hover states respond within 100ms of user interaction
- [ ] Focus indicators meet WCAG AA standards

### US-002: Capture Interaction Experience
**As a** user ready to explore the site
**I want** to click the capture button and see a realistic shutter animation
**So that** I feel satisfied with the interaction before being guided to the next section

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format):**
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Capture the Moment" button **THEN** a shutter overlay **SHALL** animate from center outward covering the entire viewport in 0.8 seconds
- **WHEN** the shutter animation reaches 50% completion **THEN** the viewport **SHALL** smoothly scroll to the next section using easeInOut curve
- **WHEN** the scroll reaches the target section **THEN** the shutter overlay **SHALL** fade out revealing the new content
- **WHEN** the user uses keyboard navigation (Enter/Space) **THEN** the same interaction **SHALL** trigger with identical timing

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Shutter animation completes in exactly 0.8 seconds
- [ ] Scroll behavior uses smooth easing and reaches correct viewport position
- [ ] Keyboard interaction produces identical results to mouse interaction
- [ ] Animation frame rate maintains ≥ 60fps throughout the sequence

### US-003: Accessibility and Performance Compliance
**As a** user with accessibility needs or slower devices
**I want** the hero component to respect my system preferences and load quickly
**So that** I can access the content without barriers or excessive waiting

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format):**
- **WHEN** the user has prefers-reduced-motion enabled **THEN** all animations **SHALL** be replaced with instant state changes or simple fades (≤ 0.3s)
- **WHEN** the component loads **THEN** the Largest Contentful Paint **SHALL** occur within 2.5 seconds
- **WHEN** content reflows during loading **THEN** the Cumulative Layout Shift **SHALL** remain below 0.1
- **WHEN** using keyboard navigation **THEN** all interactive elements **SHALL** have visible focus indicators with 3px outline

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] prefers-reduced-motion reduces all animation durations to ≤ 0.3s
- [ ] LCP measured at ≤ 2.5s across 3 different device classes
- [ ] CLS score verified at < 0.1 using Chrome DevTools
- [ ] All focus indicators pass automated accessibility scanning

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Performance Constraints
- **LCP Target:** ≤ 2.5 seconds on 3G Fast connection
- **Animation Performance:** Maintain ≥ 60fps during all transitions
- **Bundle Size:** Hero component chunk ≤ 50KB gzipped
- **Memory Usage:** Component cleanup prevents memory leaks on route changes

### Accessibility Edge Cases
- **Screen Readers:** All animations provide descriptive text alternatives
- **High Contrast Mode:** Component maintains functionality and readability
- **Keyboard-Only Users:** Tab order follows logical visual hierarchy
- **Touch Devices:** Button targets meet minimum 44px x 44px requirement

### Technical Constraints
- **Framework:** Must integrate with existing React/TypeScript architecture
- **Styling:** Only use Tailwind classes and design token CSS variables
- **Animation Library:** Framer Motion for all complex animations
- **Image Optimization:** Background images must use Next.js Image component with proper sizing

## Spec Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- Background image with blur-to-focus animation (8px → 0px blur-radius)
- Viewfinder frame overlay with corner brackets and grid lines
- Metadata HUD displaying technical skills with fade-in animations
- "Capture the Moment" call-to-action button with hover states
- Shutter animation sequence with scroll-to-next-section behavior
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Integration with existing design token system (athletic theme)

### Interactive Elements
- Skill item hover effects with color and scale transformations
- Button focus states with keyboard navigation support
- Smooth scroll behavior to next page section
- Animation sequencing with proper timing coordination

### Performance Features
- Lazy loading for non-critical assets
- prefers-reduced-motion media query support
- Optimized animation performance with transform-only animations
- Proper component cleanup and memory management

## Out of Scope

### Deferred Features
- **Advanced Camera Controls:** Zoom, focus ring adjustments, exposure settings
- **Multiple Background Images:** Image carousel or randomization
- **Sound Effects:** Shutter sound or audio feedback
- **Social Sharing:** Direct image capture or sharing functionality
- **Mobile Camera Integration:** Access to device camera or photo library
- **Personalization:** User-customizable metadata or themes

### Technical Exclusions
- **Backend Integration:** No API calls or data persistence required
- **Authentication:** No user accounts or session management
- **Analytics:** Advanced interaction tracking beyond standard page analytics
- **A/B Testing:** Component will use single implementation variant

## Expected Deliverable

### Browser-Testable Outcomes

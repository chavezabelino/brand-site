# Product Roadmap

> Last Updated: 2025-09-29
> Version: 2.1.0
> Status: "The Lens" Complete, "The Lightbox" Complete

## Strategic Vision: "The Lens & Lightbox"

A photography-metaphor-driven portfolio where the interaction itself showcases technical thinking through two unified systems:

1. **The Lens** (Navigation) - Zero-occlusion cursor-activated radial menu
2. **The Lightbox** (Content Canvas) - 2D cinematic pan-and-zoom content exploration

**Why This Works:** Instead of traditional web patterns, users experience a photographer's workflowâ€”using a lens to focus on content arranged on a lightbox canvas. The interaction IS the demonstration of skill.

**Strategic Focus:**
The roadmap emphasizes "The Lens & Lightbox" concept with both foundational phases now complete. Phase 1 "The Lens" delivered zero-occlusion cursor navigation, and Phase 2 "The Lightbox" established a production-ready 2D canvas system with 850+ lines of code, 60fps performance, WCAG AAA accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility. The system is now ready to advance to Phase 3: Content Integration & Polish, focusing on adapting existing portfolio content for the lightbox canvas and enhancing the photography metaphors that make this portfolio distinctive.

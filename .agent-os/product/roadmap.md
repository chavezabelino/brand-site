# Product Roadmap

> Last Updated: 2025-09-27
> Version: 2.0.0
> Status: "The Lens" Complete, "The Lightbox" Next

## Strategic Vision: "The Lens & Lightbox"

A photography-metaphor-driven portfolio where the interaction itself showcases technical thinking through two unified systems:

1. **The Lens** (Navigation) - Zero-occlusion cursor-activated radial menu
2. **The Lightbox** (Content Canvas) - 2D cinematic pan-and-zoom content exploration

**Why This Works:** Instead of traditional web patterns, users experience a photographer's workflowâ€”using a lens to focus on content arranged on a lightbox canvas. The interaction IS the demonstration of skill.

**Phase Guidelines:**

- Phase 1: Core MVP functionality (âœ… COMPLETED)
- Phase 2: Key differentiators (ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS)
- Phase 3: Content integration and polish
- Phase 4: Advanced features and scaling

**Effort Scale:**

- XS: 1 day
- S: 2-3 days
- M: 1 week
- L: 2 weeks
- XL: 3+ weeks

**Strategic Focus:**
The roadmap emphasizes "The Lens & Lightbox" concept with Phase 1 "The Lens" already completed (zero-occlusion cursor navigation) and Phase 2 "The Lightbox" as next priority (2D canvas with cinematic transitions). Each phase builds toward the complete vision where the portfolio interaction itself demonstrates technical and creative mastery.

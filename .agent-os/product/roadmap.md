# Product Roadmap

> Last Updated: 2025-09-30
> Version: 3.2.0
> Status: Alpha - Local Development Only
> Environment: Not in production, no deployment scheduled

## Strategic Vision: "The Lens & Lightbox"

A photography-metaphor-driven portfolio where the interaction itself showcases technical thinking through two unified systems:

1. **The Lens** (Navigation) - Zero-occlusion cursor-activated radial menu
2. **The Lightbox** (Content Canvas) - 2D cinematic pan-and-zoom content exploration

**Why This Works:** Instead of traditional web patterns, users experience a photographer's workflow—using a lens to focus on content arranged on a lightbox canvas. The interaction IS the demonstration of skill.

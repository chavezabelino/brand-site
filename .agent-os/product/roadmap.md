# Product Roadmap

> Last Updated: 2025-09-28
> Version: 2.1.0
> Status: "The Lens" Complete, "The Lightbox" Documentation Phase Complete

## Strategic Vision: "The Lens & Lightbox"

A photography-metaphor-driven portfolio where the interaction itself showcases technical thinking through two unified systems:

1. **The Lens** (Navigation) - Zero-occlusion cursor-activated radial menu
2. **The Lightbox** (Content Canvas) - 2D cinematic pan-and-zoom content exploration

**Why This Works:** Instead of traditional web patterns, users experience a photographer's workflowâ€”using a lens to focus on content arranged on a lightbox canvas. The interaction IS the demonstration of skill.

**Strategic Focus:**
The roadmap emphasizes "The Lens & Lightbox" concept with Phase 1 "The Lens" complete (zero-occlusion cursor navigation) and Phase 2 "The Lightbox" documentation phase now complete. Major achievements include comprehensive LightboxCanvas implementation, performance monitoring system, photography metaphor integration, and production-ready documentation (18 documentation files). Next priority is completing System Integration and Compatibility Validation (Task 14) to finalize Phase 2.

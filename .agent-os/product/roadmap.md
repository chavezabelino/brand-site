# Product Roadmap

> Last Updated: 2025-09-30
> Version: 3.0.0
> Status: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Functionally Complete, Phase 3 Substantially Complete

## Strategic Vision: "The Lens & Lightbox"

A photography-metaphor-driven portfolio where the interaction itself showcases technical thinking through two unified systems:

1. **The Lens** (Navigation) - Zero-occlusion cursor-activated radial menu
2. **The Lightbox** (Content Canvas) - 2D cinematic pan-and-zoom content exploration

**Why This Works:** Instead of traditional web patterns, users experience a photographer's workflow—using a lens to focus on content arranged on a lightbox canvas. The interaction IS the demonstration of skill.

**Blockers:** None - all dependencies met

### Phase 3.5 Priority Rationale

**Why This is Next:**
1. Phase 2 is functional but not fully validated per specification
2. Validation gives full confidence for production deployment
3. Only 3-5 days of focused testing work
4. No new features, just verification of existing work
5. Unblocks full production deployment with confidence
6. Completes tasks 11-16 from Phase 2 specification

**Why Not Phase 4:**
- Phase 4 requires validated Phase 2
- Phase 4 is new features, not validation
- Better to validate existing work before adding more
- Phase 2 spec explicitly defines validation as required tasks

# Product Roadmap

> Last Updated: 2025-09-30
> Version: 3.0.0
> Status: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Functionally Complete, Phase 3 Substantially Complete

## Strategic Vision: "The Lens & Lightbox"

A photography-metaphor-driven portfolio where the interaction itself showcases technical thinking through two unified systems:

1. **The Lens** (Navigation) - Zero-occlusion cursor-activated radial menu
2. **The Lightbox** (Content Canvas) - 2D cinematic pan-and-zoom content exploration

**Why This Works:** Instead of traditional web patterns, users experience a photographer's workflow—using a lens to focus on content arranged on a lightbox canvas. The interaction IS the demonstration of skill.

- 215+ tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- 91% Phase 1 test success rate maintained
- Bundle size maintained (80.11 kB gzipped)
- Performance spot-tested (60fps)
- Accessibility preserved from Phase 1 (WCAG AAA)

**Identified Gaps (Non-Blocking):**
- No formal cross-browser compatibility testing performed
- No automated performance test suite
- No canvas-specific accessibility tests
- No E2E test suite for canvas navigation
- Dolly zoom partially implemented
- Match cut transitions not explicit

**Production Recommendation:**
Deploy to production now with monitoring enabled. Create formal test suites in parallel to build long-term confidence and prevent regressions.

**Validation Documents:**
1. `phase-2-acceptance-criteria-validation.md` - Evidence-based validation report
2. `phase-2-cross-browser-testing-plan.md` - Comprehensive compatibility test plan
3. `PHASE-3.5-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md` - Overall validation results and deployment guidance

**Total Documentation:** ~925 lines of comprehensive validation and deployment guidance

### Phase 3.5 Dependencies

- ✅ Phase 2 core functionality complete
- ✅ Phase 3 content integration complete
- ✅ Gallery system complete as standalone feature
- ✅ Build system stable and optimized
- ✅ Test infrastructure and frameworks
- ✅ Browser testing tools (Playwright already in use)
- ✅ Accessibility testing tools (Axe already integrated)
- ✅ Performance profiling tools (available)

**Blockers:** None - all dependencies met

### Phase 3.5 Priority Rationale

**Why This is Next:**
1. Phase 2 is functional but not fully validated per specification
2. Validation gives full confidence for production deployment
3. Only 3-5 days of focused testing work
4. No new features, just verification of existing work
5. Unblocks full production deployment with confidence
6. Completes tasks 11-16 from Phase 2 specification

**Why Not Phase 4:**
- Phase 4 requires validated Phase 2
- Phase 4 is new features, not validation
- Better to validate existing work before adding more
- Phase 2 spec explicitly defines validation as required tasks

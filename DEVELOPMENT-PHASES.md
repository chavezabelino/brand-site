```typescript
// Week 3: AI developed camera-inspired architecture
export type SectionId = 'capture' | 'warmup' | 'gametime' | 'training' | 'actionshots' | 'contact';

// AI mapped portfolio sections to camera workflow
interface GameFlowSection {
  id: SectionId;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  cameraAnalogy: string;
}

const GAME_FLOW_SECTIONS: GameFlowSection[] = [
  {
    id: 'capture',
    title: 'Equipment Check',
    description: 'Hero section with viewfinder interface',
    cameraAnalogy: 'Camera setup and viewfinder alignment'
  },
  {
    id: 'warmup',
    title: 'Warm-Up',
    description: 'Professional background and expertise',
    cameraAnalogy: 'Lens calibration and focus preparation'
  },
  // AI autonomously mapped all sections to camera workflow
];
```

**Visual System Evolution**:

```typescript
// Week 4: AI-designed athletic timing system inspired by camera mechanics
export const athleticTiming: AthleticTiming = {
  quickSnap: {
    value: 90,  // Professional camera shutter response
    easing: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)'
  },
  reaction: {
    value: 120, // Focus adjustment timing
    easing: 'cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1)'
  },
  transition: {
    value: 160, // Lens transition timing
    easing: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1)'
  },
  sequence: {
    value: 220, // Burst mode interval

  crosshairPosition,
  onMouseMove
}) => {
  const crosshairStyle = useMemo(() => ({
    transform: `translate3d(${crosshairPosition.x}px, ${crosshairPosition.y}px, 0)`,
    willChange: 'transform',
    transition: `transform ${athleticTiming.quickSnap.value}ms ${athleticTiming.quickSnap.easing}`
  }), [crosshairPosition]);

  return (
    <div className="viewfinder-overlay" data-testid="viewfinder-interface">
      <div style={crosshairStyle} className="crosshair-system">
        <CrosshairIcon size="medium" variant="professional" />
      </div>

  );
};
```

**Advanced Component Architecture**:

```typescript
// Week 6: AI developed cursor-lens navigation system
export interface CursorLensProps {
  isEnabled: boolean;

const CursorLens: React.FC<CursorLensProps> = ({ isEnabled, activationDelay, onSectionSelect }) => {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  // AI-designed multi-method activation system
  const activationMethods = useMemo(() => ({
    clickHold: { delay: 100, active: false },
    hover: { delay: 800, active: false },
    keyboard: { key: 'Space', active: false },
    touch: { delay: 750, active: false }
  }), []);
};
```

  const [metrics, setMetrics] = useState<PerformanceMetrics>({
    frameRate: 60,
    renderTime: 0,
    memoryUsage: 0,
    bundleSize: 127000, // bytes
    componentCount: 0
  });

  // AI implemented RAF-based monitoring
  useEffect(() => {
    const monitor = new PerformanceMonitor();
    monitor.startTracking();
    return () => monitor.stopTracking();
  }, []);
};
```

        backdropFilter: `blur(${blur}px)`,
        WebkitBackdropFilter: `blur(${blur}px)`,
      };
    }
    // AI provided fallback for older browsers
    return {
      background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, ${Math.min(blur / 20, 0.8)})`,
      border: '1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)',

      settings.maxBlurIntensity = 4;
      settings.animationDuration = 100;
      settings.throttleMs = 33; // 30fps for low-power devices
    }

    return settings;
  }
}
```

**Comprehensive Testing Implementation**:

```typescript
// AI generated comprehensive test coverage
describe('Accessibility Compliance', () => {
  it('meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements', () => {
    // AI implemented automated contrast testing
    expect(getContrastRatio(courtNavy, white)).toBeGreaterThan(4.5);
    expect(getContrastRatio(brandViolet, white)).toBeGreaterThan(4.5);
  });

  it('supports keyboard navigation', () => {

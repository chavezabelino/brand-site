### Example: Successful Architecture Discovery

```markdown
✅ Architecture Discovery Success Story:

Human: "I need an architecture for a professional portfolio that demonstrates
technical sophistication to enterprise decision makers."

AI: "I recommend a component-driven architecture with React Context for state
management, TypeScript interfaces for type safety, and a performance-first approach.
Let me suggest a specific hierarchy..."

Human: "That's good, but I want to integrate a camera/photography theme throughout.
How can we make the architecture reflect that metaphor?"

AI: "Excellent! We can design the architecture around camera workflow concepts:
- ViewfinderInterface component for hero interactions
- Athletic timing system based on camera mechanics (90ms-220ms)
- Section navigation that mimics camera controls
- Performance monitoring inspired by camera EXIF data"

Result: AI autonomously developed sophisticated camera-themed architecture
that exceeded original requirements while maintaining professional standards.
```

## Component-Level Prompting Strategies

### Interface-First Development Pattern

**Pattern**: Always request TypeScript interfaces before component implementation to ensure architectural consistency.

```markdown
## Template: Interface-First Component Prompt

Create a [COMPONENT_NAME] component for a professional portfolio with these requirements:

[DETAILED REQUIREMENTS]

Before implementing the component:
1. Design comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
2. Define prop validation with error handling
3. Specify accessibility requirements (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
4. Include performance considerations (memo, callbacks)
5. Plan error states and edge cases

Then implement the component using enterprise-grade React patterns.
```

### Example: Interface-First Success

```markdown
✅ Effective Interface-First Prompt:

Create a CursorLens component that provides zero-occlusion navigation for a portfolio.

Requirements:
- Activates on click-hold (100ms) or hover (800ms)
- Displays radial navigation options
- Supports keyboard activation (Space key)
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion
- Works on touch devices (750ms activation)
- Full WCAG compliance

Before implementation:
1. Design TypeScript interfaces for all props and state
2. Define activation method types and timing configurations
3. Specify accessibility interfaces (ARIA, keyboard shortcuts)
4. Include performance monitoring interfaces
5. Plan error handling for edge cases

Then implement with comprehensive prop validation and error boundaries.
```

**AI Response**: Generated 150+ lines of TypeScript interfaces before any implementation code, ensuring type safety and architectural consistency.

## Anti-Patterns and Common Mistakes

### What Doesn't Work for Professional Portfolios

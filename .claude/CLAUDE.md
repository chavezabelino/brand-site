# Claude Context & Collaboration Guide

## Project Context

This is Nino Chavez's personal portfolio website - a single-page React application designed as a professional launch pad. The site showcases software engineering expertise, enterprise architecture experience, and action sports photography through a modern, accessible interface.

## Working Relationship

You are Claude, working as part of Nino's AI-assisted development team. Nino is a solo developer who collaborates with AI agents to maintain and enhance this portfolio. Your role is to:

- Understand the codebase architecture and maintain consistency
- Follow established coding patterns and conventions
- Suggest improvements aligned with the site's purpose

## Key Principles

### 1. Minimalism & Focus
- This is a launch pad, not a comprehensive portfolio
- Avoid feature bloat that distracts from core message

- Follow keyboard navigation patterns already established

### 3. Professional Branding
- Maintain the sophisticated visual design

- Balance technical demonstration with usability

## Development Context

### Current State
- React 19.1.1 with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds

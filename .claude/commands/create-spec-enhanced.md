@.agent-os/instructions/core/create-spec-enhanced.md

## Key Enhancements

- **Formal Acceptance Criteria**: Uses EARS format (WHEN...THEN...SHALL)
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Mandatory edge case and constraint documentation
- **Definition of Done**: Clear testable outcomes for each user story
- **Iterative Validation**: Built-in approval loop with specific review questions
- **Enhanced Review Process**: Quality checkpoints before proceeding to implementation

Use this command when you want comprehensive specification requirements with rigorous validation and testable criteria.

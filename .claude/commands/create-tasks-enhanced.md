# Create Enhanced Tasks

Break down approved requirements and design into actionable coding steps with incremental building and early testing

Refer to the instructions located in this file:
@.agent-os/instructions/core/create-tasks-enhanced.md

## Prerequisites

- Must have approved spec created with `/create-spec` or `/create-spec-enhanced`
- Optionally enhanced with `/create-design` for better task breakdown
- Requires existing spec directory in @.agent-os/specs/

## Key Enhancements (Kiro-Inspired)

- **Max 2-Level Hierarchy**: Organized main tasks with manageable sub-tasks
- **Coding-Focused Tasks**: Specific write/modify/test code actions
- **Incremental Building**: Each task builds upon previous completed work
- **Early Testing Priority**: Testing integrated throughout development phases
- **Requirement Traceability**: Each task references specific requirements/acceptance criteria
- **No Orphaned Code**: Every change contributes to working functionality
- **Quality Gates**: Phase completion checkpoints ensure readiness

## Task Organization

1. **Phase 1**: Setup and Foundation
2. **Phase 2**: Core Implementation
3. **Phase 3**: Integration and Testing
4. **Phase 4**: Validation and Deployment

## Complete Enhanced Workflow

1. `/create-spec-enhanced` → Requirements with acceptance criteria
2. `/create-design` → Technical design with architecture
3. **`/create-tasks-enhanced`** → Actionable implementation tasks (THIS COMMAND)
4. `/execute-tasks` → Guided implementation assistance

Use this command to create comprehensive, manageable implementation tasks that prevent orphaned code and ensure quality delivery.

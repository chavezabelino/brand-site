  development in [DOMAIN].

  Cover:
  - Testing strategies specific to [PROJECT TYPE] (unit, integration, [domain-specific])
  - Performance optimization achieving [DOMAIN] requirements (e.g., latency, throughput, accuracy)
  - Security/compliance standards relevant to [DOMAIN]
  - [TECH STACK] best practices and type safety
  - Quality patterns that prove enterprise-readiness to [TARGET AUDIENCE]

  For PROMPTING-STRATEGIES.md:

  Create "PROMPTING-STRATEGIES.md" with proven techniques for AI-assisted [DOMAIN] development.

  Include:
  - Vision-first prompting patterns for [PROJECT TYPE]
  - [DOMAIN]-specific quality constraints and standards
  - Architectural discovery methods for [TECH STACK] projects
  - Anti-patterns specific to [DOMAIN] development
  - Success indicators for [PROJECT TYPE] AI collaboration

  Make this actionable for others building [PROJECT TYPE] applications.

  3. Tech Stack-Specific Adaptation Examples

  For Next.js/React Projects:

  Focus on: SSR/SSG optimization, React Server Components, edge computing,
  Vercel deployment, TypeScript patterns, component architecture, bundle optimization

  For Python/AI Projects:

  Focus on: Model architecture, data pipeline optimization, MLOps practices,
  FastAPI performance, async patterns, Docker containerization, monitoring

  For Mobile Projects:

  Focus on: Native performance, cross-platform patterns, app store optimization,
  offline capabilities, device-specific adaptations, user experience patterns

  For Backend/API Projects:

  Focus on: Scalability patterns, database optimization, API design,
  security implementation, monitoring, deployment strategies, load testing

  4. Domain-Specific Themes

  Healthcare/Medical:

  Theme: "Surgical Precision" - Every decision measured, validated, compliant
  Metaphors: Operating room protocols, diagnostic accuracy, patient safety
  Quality Focus: HIPAA compliance, data accuracy, reliability, audit trails

  Financial/Fintech:

  Theme: "Market Precision" - Real-time accuracy, risk management, compliance
  Metaphors: Trading floor dynamics, risk assessment, market timing
  Quality Focus: Security, regulatory compliance, transaction integrity, performance

  Gaming/Entertainment:

  Theme: "Epic Adventure" - User journey, progression, engagement

  5. Update README.md Integration Prompt:

  Update the README.md to position this [PROJECT TYPE] as both a [DOMAIN] solution
  and comprehensive AI development case study.

  Add sections linking to all 5 documentation files with descriptions relevant to [TARGET AUDIENCE].
  Show development impact metrics meaningful to [DOMAIN] (e.g., performance benchmarks,
  security compliance, user experience metrics).

  Maintain professional presentation suitable for [TARGET AUDIENCE] evaluation while
  showcasing AI development methodology.

  6. Example Complete Prompt for Different Project:

  I want to create comprehensive documentation for my HEALTHCARE DATA PLATFORM built with
  Next.js 14, Python/FastAPI, and PostgreSQL that serves dual purposes:

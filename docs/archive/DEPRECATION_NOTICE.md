# Deprecation Notice - Content Strategy Change (October 4, 2025)

## Content Strategy Pivot

On **October 4, 2025**, the portfolio content strategy changed from showcasing Fortune 500 client work to demonstrating **personal projects and AI-assisted development methodology**.

### Old Positioning (Deprecated)
- **Headline**: "Systems Thinker â€¢ Enterprise Architect"
- **Secondary**: "Enterprise Architect & Technical Leader"
- **Focus**: Fortune 500 commerce architecture (SAP, Salesforce, Adobe)
- **Work Section**: "Commerce Architecture That Holds Up"

### New Positioning (Current)
- **Headline**: "What I Build When Nobody's Watching"
- **Focus**: Personal projects revealing technical thinking and problem-solving
- **Work Section**: 5 production-grade personal projects
- **Rationale**: Client work is NDA-restricted; personal projects demonstrate capability

# Consolidated Documentation Archive

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Reason:** Documents consolidated into UI_UX_TESTING_MASTER_GUIDE.md

## Files Archived

All testing and diagnostic documentation has been consolidated into a single comprehensive guide:
**`docs/UI_UX_TESTING_MASTER_GUIDE.md`**

### Archived Documents

## Why These Were Archived

- **Redundancy:** All information consolidated into single source of truth
- **Maintainability:** Easier to keep one document updated
- **Discoverability:** Single file to reference for all UI/UX testing info
- **Clarity:** Eliminates confusion from multiple overlapping docs

## Documentation Standards

### Audience Clarity
Each document should clearly indicate its intended audience in the frontmatter or introduction.

### Maintenance Status
Active documentation (showcase/, developer/, components/) is maintained with each feature change. Archive documentation is preserved for historical reference only.

### Cross-References
When linking between documents, use relative paths from the docs/ root for portability.

### Docusaurus Readiness
The showcase/ directory follows Docusaurus-compatible markdown conventions for future migration to a public documentation site.

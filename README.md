# Nino Chavez Portfolio: "The Moment of Impact"

A cutting-edge personal portfolio website built entirely with AI-powered development tools, showcasing the intersection of enterprise software architecture and action sports photography.

## About This Project

This portfolio represents more than just a personal brand showcaseâ€”it's a live demonstration of **AI-first development methodology** in action. Every component, animation, and interaction has been collaboratively built using advanced AI agents, resulting in a sophisticated single-page application that balances technical excellence with compelling visual storytelling.

### The "Moment of Impact" Concept

The entire experience is built around capturing the perfect momentâ€”whether it's the precise timing of a volleyball spike or the architectural decision that transforms a complex system. The UI follows a camera-inspired workflow with six distinct sections representing the professional photography process:

1. **Equipment Check** (Hero) - Camera viewfinder interface
2. **Warm-Up** (About) - Professional background and dual expertise
3. **Game Time** (Projects) - Burst-mode project showcase with EXIF-style metadata
4. **Training** (Insights) - Technical articles and thought leadership
5. **Action Shots** (Gallery) - Action sports photography portfolio
6. **Contact** - Professional connection hub

## My AI Development Team

This project showcases the future of software development through **100% AI-powered collaboration**. Every line of code, design decision, and architectural choice has been the result of human-AI partnership:

### Core AI Agents
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai)** - Primary coding assistant and architectural planning
- **[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli)** - Secondary assistant for debugging and code review
- **[Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/)** - AWS integration and cloud architecture guidance
- **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)** - Real-time code completion and pair programming
- **[Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh)** - Intelligent code editing and refactoring

### Enhanced Agent-OS Framework

I've significantly enhanced the open-source [Agent-OS framework](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os) by integrating **Amazon Kiro methodology** to create a sophisticated AI collaboration system:

**What Agent-OS Provides:**
- Structured specification creation with formal acceptance criteria
- Task breakdown methodology with incremental building approach
- Quality gates and requirement traceability
- Collaborative development workflows

**My Kiro-Enhanced Additions:**
- **Enhanced Task Creation** - 4-phase implementation with early testing priority
- **Comprehensive Context Awareness** - Agents read ALL spec documents for complete implementation context
- **Iterative Validation** - Real-time approval loops for quality assurance
- **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Specialized agents for git workflows, testing, and project management

**Key Agent Specializations:**
- `context-fetcher` - Intelligent information retrieval from documentation
- `file-creator` - Template-based file generation with proper structure
- `git-workflow` - Automated branch management and PR creation
- `test-runner` - Comprehensive test execution and failure analysis
- `project-manager` - Task completion verification and roadmap maintenance

### AI-First Development Benefits

This approach has enabled:
- **Rapid Feature Development** - Complete features from spec to deployment in hours
- **Consistent Code Quality** - AI-enforced patterns and standards across all components
- **Comprehensive Testing** - AI-generated test suites with high coverage
- **Living Documentation** - Self-maintaining specs and architectural decisions
- **Performance Optimization** - AI-driven analysis of bundle size and runtime performance

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment:**
   Create `.env.local` and add your Gemini API key:
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
